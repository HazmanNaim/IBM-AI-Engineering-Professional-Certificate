## Emergence of Deep Learning

As we've seen, neural networks have been around for a while, but why are they suddenly gaining immense popularity with a multitude of applications? To answer this question, let's dive deeper into the specifics of neural networks and the world of deep learning.

# Neurons and Neural Networks

The foundation of deep learning is deeply rooted in the functioning of neurons and neural networks, which draw inspiration from the way the brain processes information. This concept can be traced back to one of the earliest depictions of a neuron, created by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in 1899. His groundbreaking work paved the way for modern neuroscience.

Ramon y Cajal's drawing revealed that neurons have central bodies with extended arms branching out to connect with other neurons. Now, let's rotate this neuron drawing 90 degrees to the left, and you'll notice a striking resemblance to the diagrams of artificial neural networks.

## Anatomy of a Neuron

- **Soma:** The main body of a neuron, housing the nucleus.
- **Dendrites:** A network of branches extending from the soma, receiving electrical impulses (data) from sensors or terminal buttons of adjacent neurons.
- **Axon:** A long arm projecting from the soma in the opposite direction, responsible for carrying processed information.
- **Terminal Buttons (Synapses):** Whisker-like structures at the end of the axon, facilitating connections with other neurons.

In a biological neuron, electrical impulses (data) are received by dendrites, processed within the nucleus, and then transmitted through the axon to terminal buttons or synapses. The output from this neuron serves as input for thousands of other neurons. Learning in the brain is achieved by strengthening certain neural connections through repeated activation, making them more likely to produce desired outcomes based on specific inputs.

## Artificial Neurons

Artificial neurons emulate the behavior of biological neurons and share similar components, including the soma, dendrites, and axon. The end of the axon can branch off to connect with numerous other neurons. Learning in artificial neurons mirrors the brain's learning process, reinforcing connections that lead to desired outcomes based on inputs.

Understanding the components of artificial neurons sets the stage for comprehending how artificial neural networks process information.

# Artificial Neural Networks

In this video, we delve into the mathematical formulation of neural networks, building on the understanding of artificial neurons and their connections. Neural networks consist of layers, including the input layer, output layer, and hidden layers in between. Three primary topics central to neural networks are forward propagation, backpropagation, and activation functions. In this video, we focus on forward propagation.

## Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process where data flows through layers of neurons, from the input layer to the output layer. We'll mathematically formulate this process using a single neuron.

- **Inputs (x1 and x2):** Data enters the neuron through connections (dendrites) with specific weights (w1 and w2).
- **Linear Combination (z):** The neuron processes this information by calculating a linear combination of inputs and weights and adds a bias (b). So, z = (x1 * w1) + (x2 * w2) + b.
- **Output (a):** The output of the neuron (a) represents the result of this linear combination.

However, simply outputting a weighted sum of inputs limits the neural network's capabilities. To enhance processing, we apply a nonlinear transformation using an activation function, like the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function maps large positive weighted sums to values close to 1 and large negative sums to values close to 0. Activation functions are crucial for enabling neural networks to perform complex tasks.

## Importance of Activation Functions

Activation functions determine whether a neuron should be activated or not, in other words, whether the received information is relevant. Without an activation function, a neural network behaves like a linear regression model. Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling neural networks to learn and perform tasks like image classification and language translation.

## Example Calculation

For simplification, let's consider a neural network with one neuron and one input. Given:
- Input (x1) = 0.1
- Optimized Weight (w1) = 0.15
- Bias (b1) = 0.4

We calculate:
- Linear Combination (z) = (0.1 * 0.15) + 0.4 = 0.415
- Output (a) = Sigmoid(z) = 0.6023

For a network with two neurons, the output of the first neuron becomes the input for the second. The process repeats, and the final output is computed using activation functions.

In essence, this is how a neural network predicts outputs for various inputs, regardless of its complexity.

In the next video, we'll explore the training process of neural networks and how weights and biases are optimized.

2. Week 2 - Training a Neural Network

# Gradient Descent

In this video, we'll explore the concept of gradient descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost or loss function. Gradient descent is crucial for training neural networks and optimizing their weights and biases.

## Cost or Loss Function

To illustrate gradient descent, let's consider a simplified example. Imagine we have data points where z is directly proportional to x (z = 2x). We aim to find the value of the weight 'w' that best fits this data. To do this, we define a cost or loss function, often denoted as 'J,' which quantifies the error between the predicted values (wx) and the actual values (z).

## Gradient Descent Process

Gradient descent is an iterative process that minimizes the cost function to find the optimal 'w.' Here's how it works:

1. Start with an initial guess for 'w,' denoted as 'w0.'
2. Compute the gradient of the loss function at 'w0.' This gradient indicates the direction of steepest ascent.
3. Determine the step size, controlled by a parameter known as the learning rate.
4. Update 'w' using the formula: w1 = w0 - (learning_rate * gradient_at_w0)
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or until the cost reaches a predefined threshold.

## Learning Rate Considerations

Choosing the right learning rate is crucial. A large learning rate can lead to overshooting the minimum, causing the algorithm to diverge. Conversely, a small learning rate may cause slow convergence or getting stuck in local minima.

## Visualizing Gradient Descent

We visualize how gradient descent works in iterations:
- We start at w = 0 (a horizontal line), leading to a high cost.
- In the first iteration, 'w' moves closer to 2 (ideal), resulting in a significant drop in the cost.
- Subsequent iterations refine 'w' until it approaches the optimal value of 2.
- With each iteration, 'w' is updated based on the negative gradient, moving closer to the minimum.

Gradient descent is a fundamental technique that enables neural networks to learn and optimize their weights and biases effectively. In the next video, we will explore backpropagation, a crucial concept in neural network training.

# Backpropagation

In this video, we delve into how neural networks train and optimize their weights and biases using the backpropagation algorithm. Training involves adjusting the network's parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.

## Supervised Learning and Error Calculation

- Neural networks train in a supervised learning setting with labeled data.
- Training occurs when network predictions do not match ground truth.
- Error calculation: The error (E) is determined as the difference between predicted values and ground truth labels.

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- In real-world scenarios, networks are trained with thousands of data points.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) quantifies overall error across the dataset.
- The error for a single data point is squared and averaged over all data points.

## Error Propagation and Weight Update

- Error is propagated backward through the network to optimize weights and biases.
- The chain rule is used to calculate derivatives of error with respect to weights and biases.

### Weight Update for w2

- The derivative of E with respect to a2 is -(T - a2).
- The derivative of a2 with respect to z2 is a2(1 - a2).
- The derivative of z2 with respect to w2 is a1.
- Weight update formula: w2 = w2 - (learning_rate * derivative)

### Bias Update for b2

- The derivative of E with respect to b2 is -(T - a2).
- Weight update formula: b2 = b2 - (learning_rate * derivative)

### Weight Update for w1

- The derivative of E with respect to a1 is -(T - a2) * w2 * a1(1 - a1).
- The derivative of a1 with respect to z1 is a1(1 - a1).
- The derivative of z1 with respect to w1 is x1.
- Weight update formula: w1 = w1 - (learning_rate * derivative)

### Bias Update for b1

- The derivative of E with respect to b1 is -(T - a2) * w2 * a1(1 - a1).
- Weight update formula: b1 = b1 - (learning_rate * derivative)

## Iterative Training

- Training involves iterating through the dataset, calculating errors, and updating weights.
- Weights and biases are updated until convergence or a predefined threshold is met.
- Learning rate (step size) controls the magnitude of parameter updates.

## Summary

- Training begins with random weight and bias initialization.
- Iteratively repeat:
    1. Forward propagation to compute network output.
    2. Error calculation between ground truth and predictions.
    3. Backpropagation for weight and bias updates.
- Continue until a set number of iterations/epochs or error threshold is achieved.

In the next video, we will further explore the backpropagation algorithm and discuss limitations of the sigmoid function when used in hidden layers of deep networks.

# Vanishing Gradient

In this video, we explore a critical issue associated with the sigmoid activation function in neural networks—the vanishing gradient problem. This problem significantly impacted the training of neural networks.

## Recap of Derivatives

- For a simple network with two neurons, we calculated derivatives of the error with respect to weights:
    - Gradients are quite small.
    - Notice the exceptionally small gradient of the error with respect to w1.

## The Vanishing Gradient Problem

- The sigmoid activation function maps values between 0 and 1.
- During backpropagation, these small values are repeatedly multiplied.
- As we move backward through the network, gradients become progressively smaller.
- Early layers (neurons) learn very slowly compared to later layers.
- This leads to slow training and compromised prediction accuracy.

## The Solution

- The vanishing gradient problem is a major limitation of using sigmoid-like activation functions.
- In the next video, we will explore alternative activation functions that have gained popularity for hidden layers.
- These functions effectively address the vanishing gradient problem and are commonly used in modern neural networks.

Stay tuned for the next video to discover powerful activation functions that have revolutionized the training of deep neural networks.

# Activation Functions in Neural Networks

In this video, we explore various activation functions used in neural networks. Activation functions are crucial for the learning process and can significantly impact a network's performance.

## Common Activation Functions

There are seven types of activation functions:

1. Binary Step Function
2. Linear or Identity Function
3. Sigmoid or Logistic Function
4. Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Function
5. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Function
6. Leaky ReLU Function
7. Softmax Function

In this video, we'll focus on the popular activation functions: sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), ReLU, and softmax.

## Sigmoid Function

- Sigmoid function ranges from 0 to 1.
- It's commonly used but has limitations.
- Gradients become very small beyond the ±3 range, leading to the vanishing gradient problem.
- Lack of symmetry, as it produces only positive values.

The sigmoid function is defined as:
\[ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]
where \( z \) is the input to the function.

## Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) Function

- Similar to sigmoid but ranges from -1 to +1.
- It's symmetric around the origin.
- Still susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.

The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as:
\[ \tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}} \]
where \( z \) is the input to the function.

## Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Function

- The most widely used activation function.
- Outputs 0 for negative inputs, effectively sparsifying the network.
- Overcame the vanishing gradient problem and improved training efficiency.

The ReLU function is defined as:
\[ \text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z) \]
where \( z \) is the input to the function.

## Softmax Function

- Ideal for classification problems in the output layer.
- Converts network outputs into probabilities.
- Facilitates easy classification of data into categories.

The softmax function is used to compute probabilities for each class in a classification task. Given a vector \( z \) of raw scores, the softmax function calculates the probabilities \( P(y_i) \) for each class \( i \):
\[ P(y_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{z_j}} \]
where \( N \) is the number of classes.

## Choosing Activation Functions

- Sigmoid and tanh functions are less favored due to the vanishing gradient problem.
- ReLU is the primary choice for hidden layers due to its efficiency.
- Start with ReLU and experiment with other functions if needed for better performance.

Activation functions are a crucial part of designing effective neural networks, and the choice of function can significantly impact the network's learning and performance.

Stay tuned for more insights in the upcoming videos.

In the next videos, we will dive into using the Keras library to build deep learning models for regression and classification problems.

Stay tuned for more hands-on learning!

# Regression Models with Keras

In this video, we'll start using the Keras library to build deep learning models, beginning with regression problems. We'll cover the basics of how to set up a neural network using Keras for regression.

## Environment Setup in Cognitive Class Labs

To follow along with this tutorial, we'll be using Cognitive Class Labs (CC Labs) as our platform. If you haven't already, you can sign up or sign in at labs.cognitiveclass.ai. Once logged in, select the "JupyterLab" environment to start a new JupyterLab Notebook. Make sure to choose "Python 3" as the kernel for your notebook.

We've already pre-installed the Keras library in CC Labs, so you can easily import it using the command "import keras." The backend used to install Keras will be displayed after importing. In this case, we've used the TensorFlow backend.

## Regression Example

Let's dive into a regression example. We have a dataset of concrete samples with various ingredients and their compressive strengths. Our goal is to build a deep neural network to predict the compressive strength of concrete samples based on their ingredients.

Our neural network architecture consists of:
- Input layer with 8 features (ingredients).
- Two hidden layers, each with 5 nodes and ReLU activation.
- Output layer with 1 node to predict compressive strength.

Before we start with Keras, we'll prepare our data by splitting it into predictors (features) and the target (compressive strength).

Now, let's see how easily we can build and train this neural network using Keras.

## Using Keras

1. Import Keras and the Sequential model: We'll use the Sequential model because our network is a linear stack of layers. This is the most common case for building neural networks.

2. Build the layers: We import the "Dense" type of layers from "keras.layers" and add them to our model using the "add" method. We specify the number of neurons in each layer and the activation function, which we set to ReLU for hidden layers. The first hidden layer also requires an "input_shape" parameter, indicating the number of features in our dataset.

3. Define the optimizer and loss metric: For regression, we'll use mean squared error as our loss function, and we can choose the "adam" optimizer, which is an efficient optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate.

4. Train the model: We use the "fit" method to train our model.

5. Make predictions: After training, we can use the "predict" method to make predictions.

That's it! With just a few lines of code, we've built and trained a regression model using Keras.

In the next video, we'll explore building classification models using the Keras library.

For more details on optimizers, models, and other Keras methods, check out the provided document with links to Keras library sections.

# Classification Models with Keras

In this video, we will learn how to use the Keras library to build models for classification problems. We'll walk through the process of building a classification model using Keras and apply it to a dataset.

## Classification Example

Let's say we want to build a model to determine whether purchasing a car is a good choice based on its price, maintenance cost, and capacity. We have a dataset called "car_data," where each car is categorized by its price, maintenance cost, and capacity. We want to classify each car as either a bad choice (0), an acceptable choice (1), a good choice (2), or a very good choice (3) based on these features.

Our neural network architecture will be similar to the one used in our previous regression problem. It will have:
- 8 input features (predictors).
- Two hidden layers, each with 5 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Output layer with 4 neurons for the four classification categories, activated using softmax.

## Data Preparation

Before we build our model, we need to prepare our data. For classification problems in Keras, we can't use the target column as is. We need to transform it into an array of binary values using one-hot encoding, similar to the example shown here.

In other words, our model will have four neurons in the output layer corresponding to the four categories in our target variable.

## Building the Classification Model

Now, let's build our classification model using Keras. The structure of our code is similar to what we used for regression.

1. Import Keras and necessary modules: Import Keras, the Sequential model, the Dense layer, and the "to_categorical" function for target encoding.

2. Construct the model: Create a Sequential model and add layers using the "add" method. We create two hidden layers with ReLU activation and an output layer with softmax activation.

3. Define the compiler: Specify the loss measure as categorical cross-entropy (suitable for classification) and the evaluation metric as "accuracy."

4. Train the model: Use the "fit" method to train the model. You can specify the number of epochs for training.

5. Make predictions: Use the "predict" method to make predictions.

## Interpreting Predictions

The output of the predict method will provide probabilities for each class. For each data point, the class with the highest probability is selected as the prediction. The probabilities should sum to 1 for each data point.

In the provided example, the model predicts the class probabilities for each car. The class with the highest probability is the model's prediction. For example, if a car is predicted to belong to class 0, it's considered a bad choice. If it's predicted to belong to class 1, it's an acceptable choice, and so on.

In the lab part of this course, you'll have the opportunity to build your own regression and classification models using the Keras library. Be sure to complete the lab exercises to reinforce your learning.

# Shallow Versus Deep Neural Networks

**1. Advancements in the Field:** One of the key factors is the advancement in deep learning itself. The development of the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function helped overcome the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the creation of very deep neural networks. This advancement made deep learning more effective and reliable.

**2. Availability of Data:** Deep neural networks thrive when trained with large amounts of data. Having access to massive datasets has become easier than ever before. Deep learning algorithms excel when provided with extensive data, allowing them to generalize better. Unlike traditional machine learning algorithms, which may plateau in performance with more data, deep learning benefits from an abundance of data.

**3. Computational Power:** The availability of powerful GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), particularly those produced by NVIDIA, has significantly accelerated the training of deep neural networks. What used to take days or weeks to train now only takes hours, thanks to these GPUs. This increased computational power enables researchers and developers to experiment with various deep learning models and iterate more quickly.

These three factors have contributed to the widespread adoption and success of deep learning in various fields, leading to a multitude of exciting applications. Deep learning has become a driving force in artificial intelligence and machine learning research and development.

The next video in the series will dive into deep learning algorithms, starting with supervised deep learning algorithms, with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are particularly powerful for tasks involving image data.

# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

In this video, we will explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm specifically designed for image-related tasks. CNNs are a crucial tool in computer vision, enabling image recognition, object detection, and more.

## Introduction to CNNs

At their core, CNNs are similar to the neural networks we've seen earlier in this course. They consist of neurons, each with weights and biases that need to be optimized. However, CNNs make a key assumption: that the inputs are images. This assumption allows CNNs to leverage specific properties of images in their architecture, leading to more efficient forward propagation and a significant reduction in the number of parameters.

A typical CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, ReLU activation layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which are essential for generating the final output.

## Convolutional Layers

In a CNN, the input data is often in the form of an (n x m x 1) array for grayscale images or (n x m x 3) for colored images (with three color channels: red, green, and blue). Convolutional layers play a critical role. They involve defining filters and computing the convolution of these filters with each color channel.

For instance, a (2 x 2) filter can be applied to a red channel to compute the dot product with overlapping pixel values, creating a feature map. This process is repeated with a sliding filter, and the results are stored in the feature map.

Using convolutional layers rather than flattening the image into a (n x m) x 1 vector helps reduce the number of parameters, making it computationally efficient and preventing overfitting.

## ReLU Activation Layers

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions are used in CNNs to introduce non-linearity, helping the network capture complex patterns. ReLU layers filter the output of the convolutional step, passing only positive values while setting negative values to 0.

## Pooling Layers

Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of data while providing spatial variance, making the network more robust to variations in object appearance. Max-pooling and average pooling are two commonly used techniques.

In max-pooling, for each section of the image, only the highest value is retained. This helps preserve essential features while reducing dimensionality.

## Fully Connected Layers

The final layers of a CNN typically involve fully connected layers. Here, the output from preceding layers, whether convolutional, ReLU, or pooling, is flattened and connected to every node of the next layer.

For classification tasks, the output layer has nodes equal to the number of classes, with softmax activation to convert outputs into probabilities.

## Building a CNN with Keras

Using Keras, building a CNN is straightforward:

1. Create a Sequential model.
2. Define the input shape.
3. Add convolutional layers, specifying the number of filters, filter size, and activation.
4. Add pooling layers.
5. Flatten the output.
6. Add fully connected layers.
7. Specify the output layer.

In the lab part of this course, you'll have the opportunity to implement a complete CNN using the Keras library. You'll build, train, and validate the network. Make sure to complete the lab exercises to solidify your understanding of CNNs.

# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

In the previous video, we explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. In this video, we'll delve into another category of supervised deep learning models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

## Sequences and RNNs

Up until now, we've primarily seen deep learning models that treat data points as independent instances. However, there are cases where data points are not independent, such as when analyzing scenes in a movie. Traditional deep learning models aren't suitable for such applications. This is where Recurrent Neural Networks come into play.

RNNs are unique because they have loops in their architecture. They don't just take a new input at each time step; they also take the output from the previous time step and use it as part of the input for the current time step.

## Architecture of an RNN

The architecture of an RNN can be visualized as follows:

- Start with a standard neural network.
- At time t = 0, the network takes input x0 and produces output a0.
- At time t = 1, in addition to the input x1, the network also takes a0 as input, weighted with weight w0,1.
- This pattern continues for each time step, capturing temporal dependencies.

RNNs are particularly suited for modeling patterns and sequences of data, including text, genomes, handwriting, and financial markets. They excel in tasks with a temporal dimension, where the order of data points matters.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Models

One popular type of RNN is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTMs have been successfully applied in various applications, including:

1. **Image Generation:** Trained on many images, LSTM models can generate novel images.
2. **Handwriting Generation:** As described in the welcome video of this course, LSTMs can generate realistic handwriting.
3. **Image and Video Description:** LSTMs can be used to create algorithms that automatically describe images and video streams.

LSTMs are designed to handle long sequences, capture long-term dependencies, and mitigate vanishing gradient problems, making them effective for a wide range of tasks.

## Conclusion

This video provides an introductory overview of Recurrent Neural Networks. Given the scope of this course, we'll conclude here. In the next video, we'll shift our focus to unsupervised deep learning models and explore autoencoders.

# Autoencoders 

So far, we've explored two supervised deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this video, we'll shift our focus to an unsupervised deep learning model known as the autoencoder.

## What Are Autoencoders?

Autoencoders are a type of unsupervised deep learning model that serve as data compression algorithms. These algorithms automatically learn both the compression and decompression functions from the data itself, rather than relying on manual engineering by a human. Autoencoders are data-specific, meaning they can only compress and decompress data similar to what they were trained on. For example, an autoencoder trained on pictures of cars will perform poorly when compressing pictures of buildings, as its learned features are specific to vehicles or cars.

## Applications of Autoencoders

Autoencoders find application in various domains, including:

1. **Data Denoising:** Removing noise or unwanted artifacts from data by reconstructing clean versions.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving critical information for data visualization and analysis.

## Autoencoder Architecture

The architecture of an autoencoder consists of two primary components: an encoder and a decoder. Here's how it works:

1. **Encoder:** Takes an input, such as an image, and learns to compress it into an optimal, lower-dimensional representation.
2. **Decoder:** Takes the compressed representation and aims to reconstruct the original input.

Autoencoders are unsupervised because they use backpropagation with the target variable set as the same input data, effectively learning an approximation of an identity function.

## Benefits Over Basic Techniques

Autoencoders offer advantages over basic techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) because they can learn non-linear data projections. PCA can only handle linear transformations, whereas autoencoders leverage the non-linear activation functions in neural networks to learn more complex data transformations.

## Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

One specific type of autoencoder is the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). RBMs have found success in various applications, including:

1. **Fixing Imbalanced Datasets:** RBMs can learn the distribution of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset and generate more data points of that class, transforming it into a balanced dataset.
2. **Estimating Missing Values:** RBMs can estimate missing values in different features of a dataset.
3. **Automatic Feature Extraction:** RBMs are used for automatic feature extraction, especially in unstructured data.

This high-level introduction provides an overview of autoencoders and the role of Restricted Boltzmann Machines in deep learning. In the next video, we'll dive deeper into the practical implementation of autoencoders and RBMs.
