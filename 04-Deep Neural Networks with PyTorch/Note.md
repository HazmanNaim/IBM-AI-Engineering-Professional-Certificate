# Module 1 : Tensor and Datasets

## Overview of Tensors

### Introduction to Tensors

-   **Tensors:** Tensors are fundamental data structures in PyTorch used
    in neural networks. They generalize numbers and multi-dimensional
    arrays in Python.

-   **Neural Networks:** Neural networks are essentially mathematical
    functions that take one or more inputs, perform computations, and
    produce one or more outputs.

-   **Tensor Usage:** In PyTorch, neural networks are composed of
    PyTorch tensors. These tensors represent inputs, outputs, and
    parameters of the network.

### Tensor Operations

-   **Tensor Operations:** Neural networks process inputs by applying a
    series of tensor operations, which include mathematical operations
    like multiplication and addition.

-   **Vector and Matrix Operations:** Many tensor operations in neural
    networks are generalizations of vector and matrix operations.

### Working with Data

-   **Data Conversion:** In this course, data is converted into PyTorch
    tensors to be used as inputs for neural networks.

-   **Database Example:** For instance, when using a database as input,
    each row of the database can be treated as a PyTorch tensor, and
    these tensors are fed into the neural network.

-   **Image Example:** Images, represented as 2D or 3D arrays in Python,
    can be converted into PyTorch tensors for classification tasks. Each
    input tensor represents an image.

-   **Interoperability:** PyTorch tensors can be easily converted to and
    from NumPy arrays, allowing seamless integration with the Python
    ecosystem.

-   **GPU Integration:** PyTorch can also be integrated with GPUs, which
    is crucial for training neural networks efficiently.

### Parameters and Derivatives

-   **Parameters:** Parameters in neural networks are a type of tensor
    used to calculate gradients or derivatives. Gradients and
    derivatives are essential for training the neural network.

-   **`requires_grad` Parameter:** In PyTorch, you can specify that a
    tensor requires gradients by setting the `requires_grad` parameter
    to `True`. This is commonly done for parameters in neural networks.

### Dataset Class

-   **Dataset Class:** The video mentions the Dataset class, which is a
    helpful tool for working with large datasets in PyTorch. It
    simplifies data handling in neural network training.

By understanding tensors and their role in neural networks, you'll be
well-prepared to work with PyTorch for various machine learning tasks.

Certainly, let's delve into the mathematical and coding aspects of 1D
tensors as described in the video transcript.

## Tensor 1D

### Creating Tensors

-   **Definition:** A 1D tensor is an array of numbers, used as the
    building blocks of neural networks. They can represent various data
    types, such as floats, doubles, or bytes.

-   **Creating Tensors:** To create a tensor in PyTorch, you first
    import the library and then use a constructor for tensors. For
    example:

``` python
import torch
tensor = torch.tensor([7, 4, 3, 2, 6])
```

-   **Data Type:** Tensors have a data type (dtype) that represents the
    type of data they store, such as int32 or float.

### Manipulating Tensors

-   **Indexing and Slicing:** You can access individual elements of a
    tensor using square brackets and integer indices. For example, to
    access the first element: `tensor[0]`.

-   **Changing Data Type:** You can change the data type of a tensor
    using methods like `to`, e.g., `tensor = tensor.to(torch.float)`.

-   **Reshaping:** You can reshape a 1D tensor into a 2D tensor using
    the `view` method. For example, to convert a 1D tensor with 5
    elements into a 2D tensor with 5 rows and 1 column:

``` python
tensor = tensor.view(5, 1)
```

-   **Conversions:** Tensors can be easily converted to and from NumPy
    arrays and Python lists. For example, to convert a tensor to a NumPy
    array:

``` python
numpy_array = tensor.numpy()
```

-   **Scalar Conversion:** To convert a tensor to a Python number
    (scalar), use the `item` method. For example, to get the first
    value:

``` python
value = tensor[0].item()
```

### Mathematical Operations

-   **Vector Addition:** Vector addition can be performed by simply
    adding two tensors element-wise when they have the same shape.

-   **Scalar Multiplication:** You can multiply a tensor by a scalar
    value to scale all its elements.

-   **Hadamard Product:** The Hadamard product is the element-wise
    product of two tensors of the same shape.

-   **Dot Product:** The dot product between two tensors is computed as
    the sum of the element-wise products.

-   **Broadcasting:** PyTorch supports broadcasting, allowing you to add
    a scalar value to a tensor, and PyTorch will apply the operation
    element-wise.

-   **Math Functions:** You can apply mathematical functions to tensors,
    such as `sin`, `cos`, etc.

### Plotting with PyPlot

-   **Creating a linspace:** You can create an evenly spaced sequence of
    numbers using `linspace` for plotting purposes.

-   **Plotting with PyPlot:** Import the `pyplot` library
    (`matplotlib.pyplot`) to plot functions. Using `matplotlib inline`
    ensures that plots display correctly in a Jupyter notebook.

-   **Example Plot:** To plot a function, convert the tensor to a NumPy
    array, and then use `plt.plot(x, y)` to create the plot.

These mathematical and coding operations are fundamental when working
with 1D tensors in PyTorch, whether you are building neural networks,
preprocessing data, or analyzing results.

## Two-Dimensional Tensors

### Introduction to Two-Dimensional Tensors

-   **2D Tensor Definition:** A 2D tensor can be conceptualized as a
    container holding numerical values of the same data type. It's often
    represented as a matrix.

-   **Matrix Representation:** In a 2D tensor, each row corresponds to a
    different sample or data point, and each column represents a feature
    or attribute associated with those data points.

-   **Example 1 - Housing Data:** Consider a database of housing
    information. Each column represents a feature like the number of
    rooms, age of the house, and price. Each row represents a different
    house. This data can be represented as a 2D tensor.

-   **Example 2 - Gray Scale Images:** Gray scale images can also be
    represented as 2D tensors, where each numerical value corresponds to
    an intensity between $$0$$ and $$255$$ ($$0$$ for black, $$255$$ for
    white).

### Indexing and Slicing of 2D Tensors

-   **Accessing Elements:** Rectangular brackets (`[]`) are used to
    access elements within a 2D tensor.

-   **Indexing:** The first index corresponds to the row index, and the
    second index corresponds to the column index.

-   **Single Bracket Access:** Elements can also be accessed using a
    single pair of brackets.

-   **Example 1:** To access an element at row $$2$$ and column $$3$$,
    you can use indexing like this: $$\text{tensor}[1][2]$$.

-   **Example 2:** Using single brackets, you can access the same
    element as follows: $$\text{tensor}[1, 2]$$.

-   **Slicing:** You can use slicing to extract specific sections of a
    2D tensor. For example, $$\text{tensor}[1:3, 2:4]$$ extracts
    elements from rows $$1$$ to $$2$$ and columns $$2$$ to $$3$$.

### Basic Operations on 2D Tensors

1.  **Addition of 2D Tensors:** When you add two 2D tensors, it's
    similar to matrix addition. Each element at corresponding positions
    is summed.

    -   **Example:** Consider tensors $$X$$ and $$Y$$. To add them in
        PyTorch, you simply use $$Z = X + Y$$.

2.  **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a 2D tensor by a scalar
    multiplies every element within the tensor by that scalar.

    -   **Example:** If you multiply a tensor $$Y$$ by $$2$$, all
        elements in $$Y$$ will be doubled.

3.  **Element-Wise Product (Hadamard Product):** When you multiply two
    2D tensors element-wise, each element at corresponding positions is
    multiplied.

    -   **Example:** Consider tensors $$X$$ and $$Y$$. To perform
        element-wise multiplication, you can use $$Z = X \cdot Y$$.

4.  **Matrix Multiplication:** Matrix multiplication between two 2D
    tensors follows the rules of linear algebra, where the number of
    columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the
    second matrix. The resulting matrix has dimensions determined by
    these dimensions.

    -   **Example:** For tensors $$A$$ and $$B$$, you can perform matrix
        multiplication in PyTorch using $$C = \text{torch.mm}(A, B)$$.

## Differentiation in PyTorch

### Understanding Derivatives

-   **Derivatives Introduction:** In this video, we'll explore
    differentiation in PyTorch, a crucial concept for generating
    parameters in neural networks. We'll start with simple derivatives
    and then venture into partial derivatives.

-   **Derivative of a Quadratic Function:** Consider a quadratic
    function $$y$$ in terms of $$x$$. When evaluating this function at
    $$x = 2$$, it results in $$4$$. Now, let's calculate the derivative
    of this function. According to calculus rules, the derivative of a
    quadratic function like this is $$2x$$.

-   **Calculating the Derivative in PyTorch:** To calculate this
    derivative in PyTorch, we begin by creating a tensor $$x$$ and
    setting its value to $$2$$. Importantly, we also specify that this
    tensor is going to be used for evaluating functions and derivatives
    by setting the `requires_grad` parameter to `True` in the tensor
    constructor.

-   **Creating the Function and Derivative:** Next, we create a tensor
    $$y$$ and define it as $$x^2$$, which gives us a new tensor $$Y$$
    equal to the squared function of $$x$$. Since we've set $$x = 2$$,
    the value of $$Y$$ is $$4$$.

-   **Backward Function in PyTorch:** To compute the derivative of
    $$y$$, we call the `backward` function in PyTorch on $$y$$. This
    function first calculates the derivative of $$y$$ and then evaluates
    it for the value of $$x = 2$$.

-   **Using `grad` Attribute:** To obtain the derivative of $$y$$ at
    $$x = 2$$, we need to access the `grad` attribute on $$x$$. This
    attribute effectively plugs the value $$x = 2$$ into the derivative
    of $$y$$ and gives us the result, which is $$4$$.

-   **Backward Graph:** Behind the scenes, PyTorch computes derivatives
    using a backward graph, a type of graph in which tensors and
    backward functions are nodes. PyTorch decides whether to calculate
    the derivative of a tensor based on whether it's a leaf in the
    graph. If the `requires_grad` attribute is set to `True`, PyTorch
    will evaluate the derivative.

-   **Attributes of Tensors:** Each tensor in PyTorch has various
    attributes, including `data` for holding the tensor's data, `grad`
    for storing gradient values, `grad_fn` for referencing nodes in the
    backward graph, and `is_leaf` to denote if a tensor is a leaf in the
    graph.

-   **High-Level Understanding:** While we won't delve into the
    intricate details of the backward graph's construction and use, this
    overview provides a high-level understanding of how PyTorch
    calculates derivatives.

### Partial Derivatives

-   **Derivative with Multiple Variables:** In this section, we examine
    functions with two variables, $$u$$ and $$v$$. Based on calculus
    rules, the derivative of $$f$$ with respect to $$u$$ is $$v + 2u$$,
    treating $$v$$ as a constant. Similarly, the derivative of $$f$$
    with respect to $$v$$ is $$u$$, treating $$u$$ as a constant.

-   **PyTorch Implementation:** We define tensors $$u$$ and $$v$$ with
    initial values of $$1$$ and $$3$$, respectively. We also create a
    tensor $$f$$ where the value of $$f$$ is $$3$$.

-   **Calculating Partial Derivatives:** We use the `backward` function
    on $$f$$ to calculate the two partial derivatives of $$f$$ with
    respect to $$u$$ and $$v$$ and evaluate them at the values $$1$$ and
    $$3$$ for $$u$$ and $$v$$.

-   **Accessing Partial Derivatives:** To retrieve the derivative of
    $$f$$ with respect to $$u$$, we call the `grad` function on $$u$$
    and obtain the derivative evaluated at $$1$$ and $$3$$ for $$u$$ and
    $$v$$, respectively.

## Simple Dataset

### Building a Custom Dataset Class

-   **Dataset Overview:** In this video, we'll learn how to create a
    custom dataset class and apply transformations to it. The topics
    we'll cover include building a dataset class, creating a dataset
    transform, and composing multiple transforms.

-   **Importing Dependencies:** To create a custom dataset class, we
    need to import the abstract class `Dataset` from `torch.utils.data`.
    This class will serve as the base for our custom dataset.

-   **Creating a Custom Dataset Class:** We create a class called
    "ToySet," which is a subclass of the `Dataset` class. We'll see what
    happens when we instantiate this class.

-   **Attributes of the Custom Dataset Class:** In the constructor of
    our dataset class, we define the values of our features and targets
    and assign them to tensors `self.x` and `self.y`, each containing
    100 samples. We also store the number of samples in the attribute
    `length`.

-   **Customizing the `len` Function:** When we apply the `len` function
    to our dataset object, it returns the value of the `length`
    attribute. In this case, it's set to 100.

-   **Using Indexing:** Our dataset object behaves like a list, tuple,
    or any iterable in Python. We can index it using square brackets,
    which serve as a proxy for the "getitem" method. This method returns
    the sample indexed by the tensor `x` and `y` and assigns them to the
    variable `sample` as a tuple.

-   **Applying Iteration:** As the dataset object is iterable, we can
    use a loop directly to access the data. We can use a loop to obtain
    the first three samples as shown.

### Transforming the Data

-   **Introduction to Data Transformation:** Often, we need to transform
    data, such as normalization or standardization. Instead of writing
    functions, we can create callable classes that apply transforms to
    tensors. Let's create a simple transform class and apply it.

-   **Creating a Transform Class:** We create a class called
    "AddMultiply," which will be applied to the data in our dataset. It
    has parameters `add_x` and `mul_y` for adding to `x` and multiplying
    `y`. It includes a `call` method acting as a proxy for square
    brackets.

-   **Applying a Transform Directly:** Two ways to apply the transform
    to our dataset are demonstrated. First, we directly apply the
    transform to the dataset. If no transform object is passed when
    creating the dataset, the `transform` attribute is set to `None`,
    and no transformation is applied.

-   **Using a Transform Object:** Alternatively, we create a transform
    object and apply it to the dataset. The `add_x` value is added to
    tensor `x`, and the `mul_y` value is multiplied by tensor `y`,
    producing a new `sample`.

-   **Applying Transforms Automatically:** A more convenient approach is
    to automatically apply the transform when we call the "getitem"
    method. We create a transform object and pass it to the constructor,
    using an underscore in the object name to signify that a transform
    is applied.

-   **Composing Multiple Transforms:** In many cases, we need to run
    several transforms in series. To do this, we use the `Compose` class
    from the `transforms` module. We create a new transform class,
    "Mult," which multiplies all elements of a tensor by a value `mul`.

-   **Composing Transforms:** To apply multiple transforms, we create a
    `Compose` object and place a list in the constructor, where each
    element is a constructor for a specific transform. This allows us to
    apply the first transform, followed by the second transform in a
    sequence.

-   **Applying Composed Transforms:** We can apply the composed
    transform directly to the data. The input elements of the dataset go
    through the first transform, followed by the second transform, and
    are returned as a tuple containing the transformed tensors.

-   **Using Composed Transforms in Dataset Constructor:** When we
    retrieve a sample from the dataset, the original tensor is passed to
    the composed transform, where the first and second transforms are
    applied consecutively.

## Dataset Creation in PyTorch

### Building Datasets for Images

Exploring how to create datasets for images in PyTorch. We'll cover the
essential components of dataset creation, including the use of the
Dataset class for images, Torch Vision Transforms, and popular Torch
Vision Datasets.

### Components of Dataset Creation

-   **Required Libraries:** We'll start by importing the necessary
    libraries for our dataset creation. We'll be using Zalando's
    Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale
    images of clothing items. This dataset is divided into 10 classes.

-   **Accessing Data:** To access the data, you need the path to the CSV
    file containing labels for each image. You can load the CSV file
    into a DataFrame using the Pandas `read_csv()` function and view the
    data using the `head()` method. The DataFrame typically includes
    columns for clothing class and image file names.

-   **Loading Images:** To load images, you need the directory path and
    the image file name. You can concatenate the directory path with the
    image file name from the DataFrame to obtain the full path to the
    image. You can then use the `Image.open` function to load the image.
    This allows you to access and display the image along with its
    associated class or label.

### Creating a Dataset Class

The process of building a dataset class for images is similar, but it
doesn't load all the images into memory. This approach is particularly
useful for larger datasets.

-   **Constructor:** In the constructor of the dataset class, you can
    create a Pandas DataFrame as an attribute, such as "data_names."
    This DataFrame includes information about image names and their
    corresponding classes.

-   **`__getitem__` Method:** When you create an object and iterate
    through it, the `__getitem__` method is called. It's responsible for
    loading images and labels. You start by accessing a sample, for
    example, by its index. You then load the image using the associated
    path and extract the class label. Finally, you return the image and
    label as a tuple.

### Torch Vision Transforms

-   **Transforming Images:** PyTorch provides a set of widely used
    pre-built transforms for image processing. You can import the module
    and apply transforms such as cropping a 20x20 piece of the image or
    converting the image to a tensor. You can also compose multiple
    transforms and apply them to the dataset in the constructor.

-   **Dataset Pre-processing:** By applying these transforms, you can
    preprocess the images in your dataset. This is essential for
    preparing the data for neural networks.

### Torch Vision Datasets

-   **Common Datasets:** Torch Vision also offers pre-built datasets
    commonly used for benchmarking and comparison of machine learning
    models. You can import the dataset module from Torch Vision and
    create dataset objects. In this example, we use the Fashion-MNIST
    dataset. Parameters like "root" (root directory), "train"
    (indicating training or testing dataset), and "download" (for
    downloading the dataset if not present) allow you to configure the
    dataset loading process.

-   **Converting to Tensor:** As part of data preprocessing, you can
    convert the loaded images to tensors, which is a common practice
    when working with deep learning models.

## Module 2 : Linear Regression in 1D-Prediction

## Linear Regression Prediction

### Understanding Linear Regression

-   **Introduction to Linear Regression:** This video focuses on linear
    regression in one dimension and how to build a model using PyTorch.
    We will explore the fundamentals of simple linear regression and its
    components.

-   **Linear Regression Basics:** Linear regression is a method used to
    understand the relationship between two variables: the predictor
    (independent) variable $$x$$, sometimes called a feature, and the
    target (dependent) variable $$y$$. The goal is to establish a linear
    relationship between these variables.

-   **Parameters of Linear Regression:** In linear regression, the key
    parameters are the bias ($$b$$) and the slope ($$w$$). These
    parameters represent the intercept and the coefficient in the linear
    equation, respectively. During training, we'll determine these
    parameters. The trained model, representing the relationship between
    $$x$$ and $$y$$, is a linear mapping.

### The Prediction Process

-   **Mapping Variables:** The linear regression model maps the
    predictor variable $$x$$ to an estimated value of the target
    variable $$y$$, denoted as $$\hat{y}$$ (with a hat indicating it's
    an estimate).

-   **Forward Step in PyTorch:** In PyTorch, this mapping process is
    referred to as the forward step. Linear regression involves two
    primary steps:

    1.  **Training Step:** Using a set of training data points, we fit
        or train the model to obtain the parameters ($$b$$ and $$w$$).
    2.  **Prediction Step:** Once we have these parameters, we can use
        the model to predict $$\hat{y}$$ for any given $$x$$.

-   **Making Predictions:** To demonstrate prediction with arbitrary
    values, we create two tensors representing the bias and slope
    parameters. We set `requires_grad=True` since we'll learn these
    values. In this example, we set the bias to -1 and the slope to 2.

-   **Prediction Function:** We define a `forward` function, which is
    used to make predictions. We take the input $$x$$ and use it to
    calculate the estimated value of $$\hat{y}$$, following the linear
    equation of the line.

-   **Tensor Operations:** You can apply the linear equation to multiple
    values simultaneously. Each row in the tensor represents a different
    sample, and the linear function is applied to each row, resulting in
    a new tensor with the estimated values.

### Using PyTorch's Linear Module

-   **Introduction to PyTorch's Classes:** PyTorch provides built-in
    packages and classes for building and working with neural networks.
    One useful class is `Linear`.

-   **Linear Class:** To create a simple one-dimensional linear
    regression model, we'll use the `Linear` class. In this example,
    we'll create an object named `model` using this class. The
    parameters, such as the bias and slope, are randomly initialized.

-   **Using the `Linear` Class:** We import `Linear` from the `nn`
    package in PyTorch. The `in_features` parameter specifies the size
    of each input sample, while `out_features` represents the size of
    each output sample. Essentially, it creates a linear function based
    on these specifications.

-   **Accessing Model Parameters:** To obtain the model's parameters, we
    use the `parameters` method. The parameters include the slope
    (weight) and bias. It's essential to apply the `list` function to
    get an output because this method is lazily evaluated.

-   **Making Predictions with PyTorch's Linear Module:** To make
    predictions with the model, we create a 1x1 tensor for the input and
    simply call the model object to get the output. You don't need to
    call the `forward` method explicitly; using parentheses is
    sufficient.

-   **Applying to Multiple Values:** Just like before, you can apply the
    model to multiple input values. Each row in the tensor corresponds
    to a different sample, and the linear equation is applied to each
    row, considering the model's parameters.

### Creating a Custom Module

-   **Understanding Custom Modules:** In PyTorch, it is customary to
    create custom modules using the `nn.Module` package. These custom
    modules are Python classes and serve as the building blocks for
    constructing more complex neural networks.

-   **Creating a Custom Linear Regression Module:** In this example, we
    create a custom module called `LR` for linear regression. Custom
    modules are typically defined as classes and inherit from
    `nn.Module`. They can include multiple objects or layers for more
    complex models.

-   **Defining the Custom Module:** The `LR` class is defined with the
    specified input and output sizes, denoted as $$x$$ and $$y$$. By
    calling the `super` constructor, we can create objects of classes
    from the `nn.Module` package without the need to initialize them
    explicitly.

-   **Accessing Parameters:** Within the `LR` class, we define a linear
    model by creating an object of the `Linear` class. This object is
    named `self.linear`, and we can use it throughout the class.

-   **Forward Function:** The `forward` function is where we define how
    the prediction is made. Importantly, we don't need to call the
    `forward` method explicitly when making predictions. Instead, we use
    the object with parentheses, and it automatically calls the
    `forward` function.

-   **Creating and Using the Custom Model:** We create a model object
    using the constructor and specify the input size. The parameters are
    initialized randomly. In this case, this object represents a simple
    linear equation.

-   **Working with the Model:** We can access the parameters, print
    them, and make predictions using the model object. It's worth noting
    that custom modules and the use of the `state_dict` method are
    valuable when dealing with more complex models.

I apologize for any confusion. To meet your specific request for Math
Mode {2}, I'll include relevant mathematical equations in the summary,
even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Here's the
revised summary with mathematical equations:

## Linear Regression Training

### Introduction to Linear Regression Training

The video discusses the process of learning parameters for linear
regression, known as training. It provides an overview of key concepts
in linear regression training.

### Dataset and Simple Linear Regression

-   Dataset: A dataset is introduced, consisting of N points with x and
    y values. The goal is to learn the linear relationship between x and
    y.
-   Simple Linear Regression: When x has only one dimension, it's
    referred to as simple linear regression. The video explains how
    datasets are often organized as tensors. Examples of simple linear
    regression datasets are given, such as predicting housing prices
    based on house size, predicting stock prices based on interest
    rates, and predicting fuel economy based on horsepower.

### Noise Assumption

-   Noise: The video acknowledges that even if the linear assumption is
    correct, there is always some error, which is taken into account by
    assuming that a small random value (noise) is added to the points on
    the line. This noise is modeled as Gaussian.

    **Mathematics:** The Gaussian noise model can be represented as
    follows:

    $$y = mx + b + \epsilon$$

    Where:

    -   $y$ is the observed value.
    -   $m$ is the slope of the line.
    -   $b$ is the bias or intercept.
    -   $\epsilon$ represents the Gaussian noise.

### Best Fit Line

-   Best Fit Line: In linear regression, points are plotted on a
    Cartesian plane, and the objective is to find a linear function for
    x that best represents these points. Different lines are presented
    as potential fits, with some fitting the data better than others.

    **Mathematics:** The equation of a simple linear regression line can
    be represented as:

    $$y = mx + b$$

### Loss Function

-   Average Loss: A more systematic approach for finding the
    best-fitting line is introduced, which involves minimizing a loss
    function. The video mentions the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or cost
    function as the loss function. It is a function of the slope and
    bias. By trying different slope and bias values, the goal is to find
    the line with the smallest value for this function.

    **Mathematics:** The Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be represented as:

    $$MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - (mx_i + b))^2$$

## Loss

**Transcript:**

### Understanding Loss

Loss is a precursor to cost and plays a key role in determining the
parameters of a linear function, specifically, the slope and bias. To
illustrate this concept, let's start with a simple example involving a
single data point. The value of $x$ is -2, and the value of $$\(y\)$$ is
4.

**Mathematics:** To determine the parameters, we need to find a quantity
that indicates the quality of our model's estimate. This quantity,
referred to as the loss, measures the difference between our model's
estimate and the actual value we aim to predict. It is typically
calculated by squaring the difference, as shown in the equation below:

$$\[
\text{Loss} = (\text{Model Estimate} - \text{Actual Value})^2
\]$$

The goal is to find the parameter (in this case, the slope) that
minimizes this loss. The loss function, often called a criterion
function, is a function of the parameter.

### Systematic Minimization

To systematically minimize the loss, it's helpful to visualize the loss
function. This function is shaped like a concave bowl and represents the
parameter space. Different lines in the data space correspond to
different parameter values.

**Mathematics:** The loss function, denoted as $L(\text{parameter})$,
can be displayed as a concave function. To find the minimum value of the
loss function, we consider its derivative.

$$L'(\text{parameter}) = 0$$

The derivative of the loss function helps us locate the minimum value of
the loss function. For simple linear regression, we can find the best
value for the slope by setting the derivative equal to zero, solving for
the derivative algebraically, and finding the optimal slope. However,
for more complex deep learning models, this algebraic approach may not
be feasible.

## Gradient Descent

### Introduction to Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is a method used to find the minimum of a function, and
it's applicable to functions with multiple dimensions. In this video,
we'll explore the fundamentals of gradient descent, common issues with
the learning rate, and methods to determine when to stop the gradient
descent process.

### Understanding Gradient Descent

-   Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is a technique used to find the
    minimum of a function. Specifically, it is used in the context of
    optimizing machine learning models, such as linear regression.

**Mathematics:** In the context of linear regression, gradient descent
can be expressed using the following iterative equation:

$$
\text{Parameter} = \text{Parameter} - \eta \cdot \frac{d\text{Loss}}{d\text{Parameter}}
$$

Here: - $\eta$ is the learning rate, which determines the step size. -
$\frac{d\text{Loss}}{d\text{Parameter}}$ is the derivative of the loss
with respect to the parameter.

### Problems with the Learning Rate

-   Learning Rate Issues: Selecting an appropriate learning rate is
    crucial. If the learning rate is too large, you might miss the
    minimum, and if it's too small, convergence can be slow.

**Mathematics:** The choice of the learning rate ($\eta$) can
significantly affect the update of the parameter. If $\eta$ is too
large, you risk overshooting the minimum. If it's too small, convergence
may be slow.

### When to Stop Gradient Descent

-   Stopping Criteria: Deciding when to stop the gradient descent
    process is essential. Running a set number of iterations or
    monitoring the loss are common methods.

**Mathematics:** One approach to stopping gradient descent is to monitor
the change in the loss function. If the loss starts increasing, it might
indicate that you've gone past the minimum.

The video provides a practical example to illustrate gradient descent
and the selection of an appropriate learning rate.

**Note:** The detailed equations for gradient descent involve the
derivative of the loss function with respect to the parameter. The video
simplifies these equations for explanation.

Certainly, here's the revised summary with mathematical equations
enclosed in `$$` for the video titled "Cost Function":

## Cost Function

### Cost Function and Minimizing Loss

In this video, the concept of the cost function is discussed. Instead of
determining the parameter value for a single sample, we aim to find
parameters that minimize the loss value for multiple data points. To
visualize this, consider little squares whose areas represent the error.
Sometimes, the error or loss is divided by the number of samples,
whether it's the total or average error.

**Mathematics:** The cost function can be symbolically represented as
$L(\text{slope})$, where the slope controls the relationship between $x$
and $y$, and the bias controls the horizontal offset. The cost function
can be expressed as:

$$L(\text{slope})$$

### Gradient Descent

-   Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is introduced as a method for
    minimizing the cost function. It involves taking the derivative of
    the cost function.

**Mathematics:** The derivative of the cost function can be represented
as:

$$\frac{dL(\text{slope})}{d\text{slope}}$$

-   Iterations of Gradient Descent: The video explores what happens
    during multiple iterations of gradient descent, focusing on the
    slope parameter.

**Mathematics:** When taking the derivative, we get the following
expression:

$$\frac{dL(\text{slope})}{d\text{slope}}$$

-   Gradient Descent Steps: During each iteration, the parameters are
    updated based on the derivative. The magnitude of the update is
    determined by the value of the derivative.

**Mathematics:** The update step can be represented as:

$$\text{slope} = \text{slope} - \text{learning rate} \cdot \frac{dL(\text{slope})}{d\text{slope}}$$

### Batch Gradient Descent

-   Batch Gradient Descent: When all samples in the training set are
    used to calculate the loss, it is called batch gradient descent. A
    batch typically consists of all the training samples.

**Mathematics:** The loss calculation for the batch is similar to the
loss for a single sample.

**Note:** The concepts discussed in this video are fundamental in
optimization techniques used in machine learning and deep learning.

Understood, I will enclose the mathematical equations with `$$` signs.
Here's the revised summary:

## Linear Regression PyTorch

### Understanding Gradient Descent in PyTorch

-   **PyTorch Tensors**: We create a PyTorch tensor for the parameter
    $w$ and set the `requires_grad` option to true. This indicates that
    we intend to learn the parameters via gradient descent.

-   **Generating Data**: We generate some $X$ values and map them to a
    line with a slope of -3. The `view` command is used to add an
    additional dimension to the tensor. We visualize this line using
    Matplotlib.

**Mathematics:** The forward function is defined as the equation of a
line, $y = wx$.

-   **Cost Function**: We define the cost function (also referred to as
    the loss) and set a learning rate of 0.1. In this example, we
    perform 4 epochs. The cost function multiplies the tensor by the
    parameter $w$. Since `requires_grad` is set to true, PyTorch treats
    $w$ as a variable.

**Mathematics:** The cost function can be represented as:

$$
\text{Loss} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (wx_i - y_i)^2
$$

-   **Gradient Descent Steps**: During each epoch, we call the
    `backward` method on the loss to calculate the derivative with
    respect to all the variables in the loss function. To access the
    derivative with respect to the parameter $w$, we use the `grad`
    method. We update the parameter $w$ based on the calculated
    gradient.

**Mathematics:** The update step is represented as:

$$
w = w - \text{learning rate} \cdot \frac{d\text{Loss}}{dw}
$$

-   **Visualizing the Optimization Process**: The video demonstrates the
    optimization process by showing the cost function for different
    values of $w$, data points, and the line generated using the
    parameter value of -10.

**Note**: As machine learning models become more complex, it becomes
challenging to plot the cost or average loss for each parameter.
Therefore, observing the cost for every iteration is a common practice.
A list is created to store the loss for each iteration, and it is then
visualized.

**Mathematics:** The cost function can be plotted for each iteration to
observe the decrease in the average loss over time.

## PyTorch Linear Regression Training

### Understanding Linear Regression Training with Gradient Descent

In this video, we explore the process of determining the bias and slope
(or weights) with gradient descent in the context of linear regression.

-   **Cost Surface**: The cost function in linear regression is a
    fundamental concept. Mathematically, it is represented as:

$$
\text{Cost} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (wx_i + b - y_i)^2
$$

Here, $w$ is the slope, controlling the relationship between $x$ and
$y$, and $b$ is the bias, responsible for the horizontal offset. In true
linear regression, the cost function depends on two variables: the slope
and bias. This cost function can be visualized as a surface, with one
axis representing the slope and the other representing the bias. The
cost is represented by the height of this surface.

**Mathematics:** The cost surface can be represented as a function of
the slope $w$ and bias $b$.

-   **Contour Plot**: To better understand the cost surface, contour
    plots are a valuable tool. These plots offer a bird's-eye view of
    the surface. The horizontal axis corresponds to the slope ($w$),
    while the vertical axis corresponds to the bias ($b$). The contour
    lines represent points with equal cost values. By imagining slicing
    the surface at various heights (i.e., cost values), we obtain
    contour lines. Each contour represents a specific cost value.

**Mathematics:** The contour lines can be seen as intersections of the
cost surface with planes at different heights (cost values).

-   **Understanding Contour Lines**: By analyzing contour lines, we can
    gain insights into how parameter values affect the cost. Slicing the
    cost surface at different levels and observing the corresponding
    contour lines can reveal the relationship between parameter changes
    and cost changes.

-   **Minimizing the Cost Function in PyTorch**: To minimize the cost
    function in PyTorch, we initialize tensors for the weight, bias,
    $X$, and $Y$. The process is similar to the previous video, with the
    additional update of the bias term. We visualize the loss or cost
    function for different parameter values and track the progress over
    several iterations (epochs).

**Mathematics:** In the context of gradient descent, the update of
parameters can be represented as:

$$
w = w - \text{learning rate} \cdot \frac{d\text{Loss}}{dw}
$$

$$
b = b - \text{learning rate} \cdot \frac{d\text{Loss}}{db}
$$

-   **Understanding Gradient Descent**: The derivative of the cost
    function with respect to each variable is called a partial
    derivative. When these partial derivatives are organized into a
    vector, it forms the gradient. Gradient descent is named after this
    gradient vector, and it points in the direction of the steepest
    increase in the cost function.

**Mathematics:** Gradient descent involves calculating the gradient to
determine the direction of the next iteration.

-   **Visualizing the Training Process**: The video shows the training
    process through iterations. As the number of iterations (epochs)
    increases, the line's parameters approach the values that minimize
    the cost. This process demonstrates the convergence of the model to
    a solution that closely fits the data points.

**Note**: The cost function in this context is often referred to as the
loss to stay consistent with PyTorch documentation.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

### Understanding Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and DataLoader in PyTorch

-   **Overview of Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Stochastic Gradient
    Descent is introduced as an optimization method. It is explained how
    in batch gradient descent, the optimization is done using the entire
    cost function, but in SGD, parameters are updated with respect to
    individual data samples. The concept of an epoch is introduced,
    where each iteration through the data is called one epoch.

**Mathematics:** The approximation of the cost function with individual
data samples is illustrated.

-   **Fluctuations in Stochastic Gradient Descent**: It's mentioned that
    one challenge with SGD is that the approximate cost fluctuates
    rapidly with each iteration. This is demonstrated with an example
    where one sample is an outlier.

**Mathematics:** The expression for the gradient in SGD is similar to
that in gradient descent.

-   **Stochastic Gradient Descent in PyTorch**: The process of
    performing SGD in PyTorch is detailed. A PyTorch tensor is created
    for the parameter $w$ with `requires_grad` set to true, and data
    points are generated. The forward function and cost function are
    defined. Multiple epochs are run, and the parameter is updated with
    respect to individual data samples.

**Mathematics:** The cost function in SGD is discussed.

-   **Storing Loss Values and Tracking Model Progress**: The video
    explains how loss values can be stored and used to track model
    progress.

**Mathematics:** The concept of accumulating loss values is discussed.

-   **Using DataLoader**: The DataLoader concept is introduced. It is
    explained how it extends the functionality of the dataset class and
    is used to iterate through the data. A DataLoader object with a
    batch size of one is created, and the iteration process is compared
    to direct iteration through tensors.

**Mathematics:** No specific mathematical equations are presented in
this section.

The video provides an overview of Stochastic Gradient Descent and
demonstrates its implementation in PyTorch. It also introduces the
concept of a DataLoader for more efficient data handling.

## Mini Batch Gradient Descent

### Basics of Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

In this video, we explore Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, which offers
several advantages, including the ability to process large datasets that
don't fit into memory. It achieves this by splitting the dataset into
smaller samples. We'll cover the basics of Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
and how to implement it in PyTorch.

-   **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: In Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, we
    work with a few samples at a time for each iteration. It's helpful
    to think of this as minimizing a mini cost function for each
    iteration.

**Mathematics**: The cost for the first iteration is given by
$J_1(\theta)$, and for the second iteration, it's $J_2(\theta)$.

-   **Batch Size, Iterations, and Epochs**: The relationship between
    batch size, the number of iterations, and epochs is a bit more
    complex. Let's consider some examples:

**Mathematics**: To calculate the number of iterations for different
batch sizes and epochs, we simply divide the number of training examples
by the batch size:

$$
\text{Number of Iterations} = \frac{\text{Number of Training Examples}}{\text{Batch Size}}
$$

**Convergence Rate**: The convergence rate, representing how quickly the
cost decreases, can be depicted mathematically as:

$$
\text{Convergence Rate} = \frac{1}{\text{Number of Iterations}}
$$

This mathematical equation shows that the convergence rate is inversely
proportional to the number of iterations. A smaller number of iterations
results in a faster convergence rate, while a larger number of
iterations leads to a slower convergence rate.

By visually observing the cost or average loss with different batch
sizes, you can intuitively grasp how the convergence rate varies.

Certainly, I'll use \### as subtitles for topics in the summary. Here's
the revised summary:

## Optimization in PyTorch

### SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

### Methodology Overview

In this segment, we're going to introduce the PyTorch Optimizer, a
critical tool for various gradient descent techniques in PyTorch. You'll
find this method used extensively throughout the course. Here's an
overview of the steps involved:

### Data Preparation

We start by creating a dataset object to handle our data.

### Custom Module Creation

Next, we create a custom module or class as a subclass of `nn.Module`.
This module represents our neural network model.

### Cost Function Setup

We create a cost function (also known as a criterion), but in this case,
we import the function from the `nn` module.

### Data Loader Initialization

We create a data loader object to handle our data in mini-batches.

### Model Definition

The neural network model is created.

### Optimizer Selection

We import the `optim` package from PyTorch, and then construct an
optimizer object. In this case, we're using Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD). The optimizer will hold the current state and update the
parameters based on computed gradients. We provide the model's learnable
parameters as input to the optimizer constructor, along with any
optimizer-specific options, such as the learning rate.

### Optimizer State

Similar to the model, the optimizer has a state dictionary that allows
us to access and update the learnable parameters.

### Training Process

The training process typically follows this methodology:

-   For each epoch:
    -   Obtain samples for each batch.
    -   Make predictions using the model.
    -   Calculate the loss or cost.
    -   Set the gradient to 0 (a necessary step due to how PyTorch
        calculates gradients).
    -   Differentiate the loss with respect to the model's parameters.
    -   Apply the `step` method of the optimizer, which updates the
        parameters based on the computed gradients.

### Visualizing the Optimization Process

The optimization process can be visualized as a series of steps
connecting the data, model, loss function, and optimizer:

-   The optimizer object holds the learnable parameters and connects to
    the model.
-   The loss is calculated based on model predictions and actual values.
-   The `backward` method differentiates the loss.
-   The `step` method of the optimizer updates the parameters.

This methodology forms the foundation of most training processes in
PyTorch.

## Training, Validation, and Test Split

### Introduction to Overfitting

The concepts of training, validation, and test data, with a primary
focus on avoiding overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model fits well
with a limited set of data points but doesn't generalize to data outside
of that set, such as outliers. It's commonly observed in complex models
that perform well on the training dataset but poorly on unseen data.

### Data Splitting

To mitigate overfitting, we split our dataset into three distinct parts:

1.  **Training Data:** This is the data we use for model training, where
    we obtain model parameters such as bias and slope through methods
    like gradient descent.

2.  **Validation Data:** A portion of the dataset set aside for
    fine-tuning and optimizing hyperparameters. We'll discuss the use of
    validation data in this video.

3.  **Test Data:** Reserved for evaluating how well your model performs
    in the real world. We won't delve into test data in this video.

### Utilizing Training Data

We use the training data to acquire model parameters via training, such
as bias and slope, typically using gradient descent. However, certain
aspects of the model, referred to as hyperparameters, can be adjusted.
Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate and batch size.

### The Role of Validation Data

The validation data is crucial for selecting the best hyperparameters
for your model. Here's an example of how this works:

1.  We try different hyperparameters, e.g., two different learning
    rates.

2.  Using the first learning rate, we train the model and get the first
    model with updated parameters.

3.  We try the second learning rate, train the model, and obtain the
    second model with different parameters.

4.  For each model, we calculate the cost on the validation data. We
    select the model that minimizes the validation error. The cost on
    validation data can be calculated using the following formula:

    $$J_v = \frac{1}{N_v} \sum_{i=1}^{N_v} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

    Where:

    -   $J_v$ is the cost on the validation data.
    -   $N_v$ is the size of the validation set.
    -   $y_i$ is the actual value for the ith sample.
    -   $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value for the ith sample.

### Selecting the Optimal Model

To choose the best model, we calculate the cost for the validation data
for all models and select the one that minimizes this cost.

### Example with a Single Validation Sample

Here's a simplified example using one sample of validation data:

-   Actual value $y_1 = 15$, and $x = 0$ for one sample.

-   The cost on the validation data simplifies to:

    $$J_v = (15 - \hat{y}_1)^2$$

-   We calculate the cost for the first model, resulting in a value of
    256.

-   The second model, in this case, yields a loss of zero.

-   Consequently, we would select the second model as it has the lower
    cost.

### Visualizing Hyperparameter Tuning

In the plot provided, we see the cost for the training data in blue and
the validation data in orange, with different learning rates represented
on the x-axis. The curve shows how cost varies with different learning
rates, helping us identify the optimal hyperparameter settings.

### The Role of Random Data Splitting

Usually, the split between training, validation, and test data is
performed randomly.

This approach helps us understand the necessity of validation data in
optimizing models and mitigating overfitting.

### Training, Validation, and Test Split in PyTorch

In this guide, we'll explore how to train, validate, and save your model
in PyTorch. We'll use a deterministic data split and create artificial
data to illustrate the process. Here are the key steps:

### Generating Artificial Data

1.  **Data Split:** While we often split data randomly, this example
    uses a deterministic split. We create an artificial dataset class,
    allowing us to produce both training and validation data. The
    training data includes outliers.

2.  **Target Linear Function:** Our goal is to model a linear function.

### Creating Data Sets

3.  **Data Set Objects:** We create two dataset objects---one for
    training data and the other for validation data. The training data
    contains the outliers.

4.  **Visualizing Outliers:** By overlaying the training data points (in
    red) over the function that generated the data, we can clearly see
    the outliers, such as those around x = -3 and x = 2.

### Implementing Linear Regression

5.  **Custom Module:** We create a custom module for linear regression.

6.  **Criterion and Optimizer:** We set up our criterion (usually a loss
    function) along with the training data loader object. For this
    example, we adjust only the learning rate.

7.  **Hyperparameter Search:** We define the number of epochs, a list of
    different learning rates, and tensors for tracking training and
    validation costs. Additionally, we use a list to store models for
    various learning rates.

### Training Loop

8.  **Training Loop Overview:** The training loop consists of multiple
    iterations, each trying a different learning rate.

9.  **Model Creation:** For each iteration, we create a new model and
    optimizer.

10. **Prediction and Loss:** We make predictions using the training
    data, calculate the loss, and store it as training error. We do the
    same for the validation data and store it as validation error.

11. **Data Size Consideration:** When dealing with larger datasets,
    using dataset.x and dataset.y might not be feasible. Here, we use
    the `item()` method from the loss object to extract numerical loss
    values.

12. **Appending Models:** We append each model to the list.

### Model Selection

13. **Training and Validation Loss:** We plot both the training and
    validation losses for each learning rate. The learning rate
    providing the smallest validation loss is considered optimal.

14. **Selecting the Best Model:** We can obtain the best model from the
    list based on the optimal learning rate.

15. **Validating the Model:** We make predictions using the best model
    and plot the data. The line with the optimal learning rate is
    closest to all data points.

This process helps in selecting the best model and hyperparameters to
prevent overfitting and enhance the model's performance.

### Further Model Improvements

While this guide provides insights into the training, validation, and
selection process, there are numerous methods and techniques to further
improve your model. Additionally, you can explore saving the model for
future use.

## Multiple Linear Regression in PyTorch

In this guide, we delve into multiple linear regression in multiple
dimensions using PyTorch, which serves as a fundamental building block
for more complex models. Here's an overview:

### Key Concepts in Multiple Linear Regression

#### Predictor Variables

In multiple linear regression, we work with multiple predictor
variables, often represented as X. In this example, we utilize four
predictor variables: w1, w2, w3, and w4.

##### Bias and Coefficients

Introducing the bias (typically represented as b) and coefficients w1,
w2, w3, and w4, which are parameters learned during training.

#### Matrix Representation

We represent multiple samples of predictor variables (X) as a matrix,
often denoted as uppercase X. Each row in the matrix corresponds to a
different sample, and using colors, we visualize the relationships
between these samples.

#### Linear Transformation

The goal is to transform the input variables X into output values Y
(y-hat) through a linear transformation, expressed as y-hat = X \* w +
b. Here, X and w are tensors, and \* denotes a dot product.

Mathematical Equation: $$\[ y_{hat} = X \cdot w + b \]$$

#### Dot Product Operations

To perform vector operations, we use dot products. It's crucial that the
number of columns in X matches the number of rows in w. The bias term
(b) is added after the dot product, yielding y-hat.

Mathematical Equation: $$\[ y_{hat} = X \cdot w + b \]$$

#### Graph Representation

We represent the relationship between features (X) and parameters (w)
using directed graphs, providing insights into how dot products
function. These graphs form the foundation for understanding neural
networks.

#### Extension to Multiple Samples

In the case of multiple samples, we perform linear regression for each
sample, resulting in multiple predictions. Each sample's prediction
depends on the dot product of that sample's features and the parameters.

### Implementing Multiple Linear Regression in PyTorch

##### Using the Linear Class

In PyTorch, we employ the nn.Linear class for linear regression, found
within the nn package. The parameters (weights and bias) are randomly
initialized and can be accessed using the parameters method.

Pseudocode:

```         
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a Linear regression model
model = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
```

#### Creating a Model Object

We create a model object using nn.Linear. The constructor takes two
arguments: in_features (the size of the input features) and out_features
(the size of the output). This object essentially represents a linear
function.

Pseudocode:

```         
model = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
```

#### Shape Representation

Visualizing the shape of data helps us understand the relationship
between in_features (number of columns of X) and the model weights. The
parameters method provides access to the model's parameters, including
weights and bias.

Pseudocode:

```         
# Access model parameters
params = list(model.parameters())

# Shape of model weights
weights_shape = params[0].shape
```

#### Making Predictions

We can make predictions using the model for a single input or for
multiple inputs (samples).

Pseudocode:

```         
# Make predictions for input x
predictions = model(x)
```

### Custom Modules in PyTorch

#### Custom Modules

In PyTorch, custom modules are classes that inherit from nn.Modules. We
create a custom module named "LR" (Linear Regression) in the context of
regression. While it may seem redundant for simple linear regression,
this approach is essential for building more complex neural networks.

Pseudocode:

```         
import torch.nn as nn

class LR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(LR, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)
```

#### Custom Module Constructor

In the custom module class, the constructor accepts the input and output
sizes (in_features and out_features). We use super to initialize the
parent class.

Pseudocode:

```         
class LR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(LR, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
```

#### Creating a Linear Object

We create a linear object within the custom module by specifying
in_features and out_features arguments. This object behaves like a
linear layer.

Pseudocode:

```         
# Inside the LR class constructor
self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
```

#### Forward Method

The forward method is where we perform the linear transformation (dot
product) to make predictions. We can call the custom module with input
data, and it behaves similarly to the nn.Linear layer.

Pseudocode:

```         
class LR(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)
```

This guide provides a comprehensive understanding of multiple linear
regression and how to implement it in PyTorch. Custom modules are
introduced as a foundation for building more advanced models. Training
and obtaining parameters will be discussed in subsequent sections.

## Multiple Linear Regression Training

In this training procedure for Multiple Linear Regression, we'll cover
the cost function, gradient descent for Multiple Linear Regression, and
how to perform these calculations in PyTorch. While we won't dive deep
into the math, the following concepts are important:

### Cost Function for Multiple Linear Regression

Mathematically, the cost function is represented as:

$$\[
J(w) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
\]$$

Here, $w$ is a vector containing the weights and bias, $h(x^{(i)})$
represents the predicted values, and $y^{(i)}$ represents the actual
values. The goal is to minimize this cost function.

### Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression

For Multiple Linear Regression, the gradient of the loss function with
respect to the weights and bias is calculated. The update equation for
the weights is:

$$\[
w = w - \alpha \nabla J(w)
\]$$

This updates the weights as a vector.

### Training in PyTorch

Here's how to train a Multiple Linear Regression model in PyTorch:

#### Data Preparation and Libraries

-   Import the required libraries.
-   Utilize the `linear` class, as used in previous sections.
-   Create a dataset object using the `Data2D` class, specifying the
    input dimensions (e.g., two in this case).

#### Model Setup

-   Create a dataset object.
-   Define the cost function (criterion).
-   Create a train loader object with a specified batch size.
-   Define the model, specifying the number of input features and one
    output.
-   Create an optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1.

#### Training Loop

-   Loop through each epoch.
-   Obtain samples for each batch.
-   Make predictions using the model.
-   Calculate the loss or cost.
-   Set the gradient to zero; this is essential for PyTorch's gradient
    calculation.
-   Differentiate the loss with respect to the parameters.
-   Apply the `step` method to update the parameters.

#### Model Representation

-   You can visualize the model as a plane or a line in two dimensions.
-   The training data points are typically represented in red.
-   After running several epochs (e.g., 100), you'll notice an
    improvement in how the plane fits the data points.

While we've omitted detailed pseudocode and mathematical equations to
keep it concise, this is the general process for training a Multiple
Linear Regression model. If you have any questions or need specific code
snippets or equations, please feel free to ask.

### Further Considerations

Remember that the main goal in training a Multiple Linear Regression
model is to find the best set of weights and bias to minimize the cost
function and achieve the most accurate predictions.

## Linear Regression with Multiple Outputs in PyTorch

In this tutorial, we delve into Linear Regression with Multiple Outputs
using PyTorch. We'll explore custom modules for both single and multiple
samples, accompanied by the relevant mathematical equations and
pseudocode.

### Multiple Linear Equations

We are dealing with multiple linear equations, each linked to a distinct
set of parameters. These equations can be concisely expressed using
matrix operations, where parameter values are stored in matrix **W**.
Mathematically, this can be represented as follows:

For the **i**-th output: $$\[y_i = X \cdot W_i + b_i\]$$

Here, $y_i$ represents the $i$-th output, $X$ is the input, $W_i$ is the
parameter matrix for the $i$-th output, and $b_i$ is the bias term for
the $i$-th output.

### Prediction for Single Sample

Let's delve into predicting the output for a single input sample. We'll
illustrate this process using the pseudocode:

1.  Given a sample $x$.
2.  Represent the parameters of the first linear function in red, and
    the parameters of the second linear function in blue.
3.  Compute the dot product of the input $x$ with the first column of
    the parameter matrix **W** for the first linear function.
4.  Add the bias term for the first linear function.
5.  The result is the output of the first equation.
6.  Perform similar computations for the second linear function to
    obtain its output.

### Custom Module

To implement this in PyTorch, we create a custom module for the linear
model. The constructor takes the input dimension (number of features)
and the output dimension (number of outputs). Here's how it's done:

``` python
class CustomLinearModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(CustomLinearModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)
```

### Model Creation

When creating an instance of the custom linear model, we specify the
input and output dimensions, setting the number of features and bias
terms. This can be represented using pseudocode as follows:

``` python
# Create a linear regression object with 2 input features and 2 outputs
model = CustomLinearModel(input_dim=2, output_dim=2)
```

### Prediction for Single and Multiple Samples

-   **Single Sample Prediction:** For a single input tensor $x$, we
    obtain two tensor outputs using the model. The outputs correspond to
    the two different output columns.

-   **Multiple Sample Prediction:** For multiple samples, the process
    remains consistent. We use colors to represent the output for
    multiple samples. Here's how this can be represented mathematically:

For multiple samples, if $X$ is a matrix containing the samples, and $Y$
is a matrix containing the outputs, the relationship can be expressed
as:

$$\[Y = X \cdot W^T + B\]$$

Where: - $Y$ is the output matrix. - $X$ is the input matrix. - $W$ is
the parameter matrix. - $B$ is the bias matrix.

The mathematical representation and pseudocode provide a clear
understanding of the prediction process for single and multiple samples
in PyTorch.

## Training Multiple Output Linear Regression Model

In this tutorial, we will explore how to train a Linear Regression model
with multiple outputs. Our target values **y** and our predictions
**yhat** are represented as vectors, and the cost function is defined as
the sum of squared distances between our predictions and the target
values **y**.

### Cost Function

The cost function, which quantifies the difference between predictions
and targets, is expressed as:

$$\[Cost = \sum (y - yhat)^2\]$$

Here, **y** represents the target vector, and **yhat** represents the
predicted vector.

### Model Architecture

The core of our model is a custom module or class. The primary
difference here is that the parameter matrix **W** is used, and the bias
terms are also vectors. The architecture of our custom module or class
remains the same.

### Data Preparation

In the data preparation phase, we'll generate two targets, and our
dataset class will be responsible for creating these data points. We
follow these steps:

1.  Create a dataset object.
2.  Define a criterion or cost function.
3.  Create a train loader object with a batch size of one.
4.  Initialize our model by specifying two input features and two
    outputs.

### Optimization Process

The optimization process, which is consistent with training models,
includes iterating through epochs and batches. The key steps within each
epoch are as follows:

1.  Obtain samples for each batch.
2.  Make predictions using the model.
3.  Calculate the loss or cost.
4.  Reset gradients to zero, adhering to PyTorch's gradient calculation
    process.
5.  Calculate gradients by differentiating the loss with respect to the
    model parameters.
6.  Apply the optimization step to update the parameters.

### Vector Operations

During the optimization step, the model parameters are updated using
vector operations. This process efficiently handles the matrix of
weights **W**, bias vectors, and the gradients.

Overall, this tutorial provides insights into training a Linear
Regression model with multiple outputs in PyTorch, and the associated
mathematical equations and code segments demonstrate the model training
process effectively.

## Linear Classifier and Logistic Regression

In this tutorial, we'll delve into linear classifiers and, more
specifically, logistic regression---a particular type of linear
classifier. Linear classifiers aim to classify data points into
different classes based on their features. We will visualize this
concept and explore key components of logistic regression.

### Data Representation

1.  We begin with a dataset consisting of multiple samples, each with a
    specific number of features.
2.  We assume that each sample belongs to a particular class,
    represented by discrete values denoted by different colors (e.g.,
    red, blue, and green).

### Data Storage

-   Feature data for each sample is stored in a matrix, where columns
    represent distinct features, and rows represent individual samples.
-   Class labels are recorded in a class vector **y**, with each element
    corresponding to the class of the respective sample in data matrix
    **X**.

### Class Separation

-   The goal is to classify data points based on their features and
    determine their class labels.
-   A line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) can be used for class
    separation.

### Linear Separation

-   The equation of a line in one dimension is represented as
    $wx + b = 0$, where $w$ denotes the weight term and $b$ denotes the
    bias term.
-   In multi-dimensional cases, the line equation generalizes to
    $w^T x + b = 0$, where $w$ and $x$ represent vectors.
-   Data is considered linearly separable if it can be divided by a line
    or hyperplane into distinct classes.

### Threshold Function

-   Class prediction can be made by passing the output of the linear
    classifier through a threshold function.
-   For instance, if $Z > 0$, the threshold function returns $1$;
    otherwise, it returns $0$.

### Logistic Regression

-   Logistic regression improves on the threshold function by using the
    sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is expressed as
    $$\(\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\)$$.

-   Sigmoid Function Properties:

    -   For very negative $z$, the sigmoid function is close to (0.
    -   For very positive $z$, the sigmoid function is close to (1.
    -   For $z$ around
        $0\, the sigmoid function is approximately \(0.5$.

### Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

-   To classify data, the sigmoid function is combined with a threshold.
-   If the output of the sigmoid function is greater than $0.5$, the
    class label is set to $1$; otherwise, it is (0.

### Multidimensional Classification

-   In multi-dimensional scenarios, we use a plane (or hyperplane) to
    classify samples. The plane divides the data into different classes.
-   For binary classification, the plane is analogous to the line in two
    dimensions.

### Probability Interpretation

-   Logistic regression can be viewed as providing class probabilities.
-   The probability of a sample belonging to class $1$ is calculated
    using the logistic function.
-   Similarly, the probability of the sample belonging to class $0$ can
    be determined.

This tutorial provides insights into linear classifiers and logistic
regression, emphasizing the mathematics and concepts behind their
application for classification tasks. The combination of linear
separation and the sigmoid function makes logistic regression a powerful
tool for binary and multi-class classification problems.

## Logistic Regression and Prediction in PyTorch

In this tutorial, we will explore logistic regression in PyTorch,
focusing on prediction. Logistic regression is a key concept in machine
learning, and we'll dive into creating logistic functions and logistic
regression models using PyTorch.

### Logistic Function

-   Logistic regression involves a linear function followed by a
    logistic function.
-   The logistic function transforms the linear output to an estimate,
    often denoted as $\hat{y}$.
-   You can apply logistic regression to vectors with dot product
    operations.
-   The output remains one-dimensional.

### Creating Logistic Functions in PyTorch

#### Method 1: Using `torch.nn`

-   Create data, such as input tensor.
-   Use `nn.Sigmoid` to create a sigmoid object and pass the input
    tensor to it.
-   The result is the logistic estimate.
-   Visualize the estimate as a plot.

#### Method 2: Using `torch`

-   Similar to method 1, create data and the input tensor.
-   In this case, the sigmoid function is a real function.
-   Apply the sigmoid function directly to the input tensor.
-   Visualize the output.

### Creating Logistic Regression Models

-   PyTorch provides the `nn.Sequential` package for efficient model
    creation.
-   You start with a linear constructor and then use a sigmoid
    constructor.
-   Both input and output dimensions are one in logistic regression.
-   The sequential constructor builds the model, passing the input
    through the linear and sigmoid components.

### Custom Modules in PyTorch

-   Custom modules can be created by sub-classing the `nn.Module`
    package.
-   An example custom module for logistic regression is demonstrated.
-   It's similar to linear regression but applies the sigmoid function
    to the output.
-   A model is created by specifying the input dimension (1 in this
    case).

### Comparison: Custom Module vs. Sequential Model

-   A side-by-side comparison of a custom model and a sequential model
    is presented.
-   Both models are constructed, each taking an input dimension of 1.
-   They will produce the same output.

### Making Predictions

-   Consider some sample parameter values for a logistic regression
    model.
-   Define the input tensor, such as $x = 1$.
-   Apply the model to the input, first with a linear function and then
    with the sigmoid function, resulting in an output.

### Multi-Sample Input

-   Predictions on multi-sample inputs follow a similar process to
    single-sample inputs.
-   Apply the model to the multi-sample input, resulting in an output
    with multiple elements.
-   Each element in the output corresponds to a single sample in the
    input.

### Multidimensional Input

-   Logistic regression can also be applied to multidimensional inputs.
-   A 2D input example is demonstrated.
-   The model behaves similarly to the 1D case, with input dimension
    adjusted accordingly.

### Visualizing the Process

-   A step-by-step overview of applying logistic regression to 2D input
    is provided.
-   This includes data preparation, sample parameter values, model
    application, and output interpretation.

This tutorial covers the key aspects of logistic regression, creating
logistic functions and models, and making predictions in PyTorch.
Understanding these fundamentals is essential for practical machine
learning tasks and model building.

## Bernoulli Distribution and Maximum Likelihood Estimation

In this tutorial, we will explore the Bernoulli distribution and the
concept of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We'll use a biased coin
flip as an example to understand how MLE works.

### Bernoulli Distribution

-   Consider a biased coin flip, where the probability of heads is
    $$\theta = 0.2$$ and the probability of tails is
    $$1 - \theta = 0.8$$.
-   We can represent both probabilities with the Bernoulli parameter,
    $$\theta$$.
-   The probability of heads is $$\theta$$ and the probability of tails
    is $$1 - \theta$$.
-   The likelihood of a sequence of events is calculated by multiplying
    the probability of each individual event.

### Calculating Likelihood

-   For example, consider a sequence of three events: heads ($$0.2$$),
    heads ($$0.2$$), tails ($$0.8$$).
-   The likelihood is calculated as
    $$0.2 \times 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.096$$.

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

-   In real-world scenarios, we may not know the value of the parameter
    $$\theta$$.

-   To estimate $$\theta$$, we consider various sample values for
    $$\theta$$.

-   For example, we consider $$\theta = 0.5$$ and $$\theta = 0.2$$.

-   We calculate the likelihood for these values of $$\theta$$ for each
    event in a sequence.

-   The likelihood values for each $$\theta$$ are computed.

-   For instance, for the sequence (heads, tails, heads, tails):

    -   Likelihood for $$\theta = 0.5$$:
        $$0.25 \times 0.5 \times 0.25 \times 0.5 = 0.015625$$
    -   Likelihood for $$\theta = 0.2$$:
        $$0.2 \times 0.8 \times 0.2 \times 0.8 = 0.02048$$

-   The likelihood corresponding to $$\theta = 0.5$$ is larger than that
    for $$\theta = 0.2$$ which intuitively makes sense for an unbiased
    coin.

### Likelihood Function

-   The sequence of events can be represented using the Bernoulli
    distribution.

-   We use $$0$$ for heads and $$1$$ for tails.

-   The probability of $$y = 0$$ is given by $$\theta$$, and the
    probability of $$y = 1$$ is $$1 - \theta$$.

-   Both probabilities are functions of $$\theta$$.

-   Generalizing for any value of $$y$$:

    -   Probability of $$y$$ for a specific $$\theta$$ is given by:
        $$\theta^y \cdot (1 - \theta)^{1-y}$$.

### Maximizing Likelihood

-   The goal is to find a value of $$\theta$$ that maximizes the
    likelihood function.
-   Visualize it as a product of individual probabilities, aiming to
    maximize their overlap.
-   Maximizing the likelihood function can be challenging.
-   Using the log-likelihood function simplifies the process.
-   The log-likelihood function is monotonically increasing, preserving
    the location of the maximum value.

### Log-Likelihood Function

-   The expression for the log-likelihood function is:
    $$\log L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\theta) + (1-y_i) \log(1 - \theta)]$$.
-   We use this equation to find the value of $$\theta$$ that maximizes
    the likelihood.

This tutorial explains the Bernoulli distribution, how to calculate
likelihood, and how to estimate the maximum likelihood for the parameter
$$\theta$$ in a probabilistic model. The log-likelihood function
simplifies the optimization process, making it a powerful tool in
statistical modeling.

## Softmax

We'll delve into the Softmax function, both in 1D and 2D, and understand
its internal mechanisms. We will use examples and visualizations to
grasp the functionality of the Softmax function.

### Introduction to Softmax

-   Similar to logistic regression, the Softmax function is used for
    classification, but it can handle multiple classes instead of just
    two.
-   We will explore the 1D case first, then extend our understanding to
    the 2D case. This will provide intuition on how Softmax generalizes
    to multiple dimensions.

### 1D Softmax: Example

-   Imagine a classification problem with three classes and a
    one-dimensional feature vector $$x$$.

-   Classes are represented as:

    -   Class 0: Blue points
    -   Class 1: Red points
    -   Class 2: Green points

-   We use lines with different weights and bias terms to classify data.

-   There are three lines, each associated with weights and bias terms.

-   We'll examine the outputs of these lines by plugging in different
    values for $$x$$.

-   For each line, we compare the output for various $$x$$ values. For
    example:

    -   If we have $$x$$ in the blue region, the output of the blue line
        ($$z_0$$) will be greater than the other lines.
    -   If $$x$$ is in the red region, the output of the red line
        ($$z_1$$) will be the largest.
    -   For the green region, the green line ($$z_2$$) will have the
        highest output.

-   To make predictions, we use the argmax function, which returns the
    index corresponding to the largest value in a sequence.

-   We apply the argmax function to find the line with the highest
    output for a given value of $$x$$, and that's the predicted class
    ($$y_{\text{hat}}$$).

### 2D Softmax: General Case

-   In the general case, we deal with multi-dimensional inputs.

-   For illustration, we use the MNIST dataset, which contains
    handwritten digits (0-9).

-   Each image is transformed into a vector with 784 values.

-   The Softmax function considers the weights and bias terms as vectors
    in multi-dimensional space.

-   Visualizing this in 2D helps understand the concept.

-   Each parameter vector ($$w_0$$, $$w_1$$, $$w_2$$) represents the
    parameters of Softmax in 2D.

-   The Softmax function finds the class nearest to each parameter
    vector.

-   Anything in the quadrant nearest to $$w_0$$ is classified as red, to
    $$w_1$$ as blue, and to $$w_2$$ as green.

### 2D Softmax: Examples

-   To illustrate, we take two 2D vectors, $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$,
    representing the digits 0 and 1.

-   Softmax computes the dot product between each input vector and the
    parameter vectors, then uses the argmax function to classify them.

-   $$x_1$$ will be classified as class 0 because it is closest to
    $$w_0$$.

-   Similarly, $$x_2$$ will be classified as class 1 because it is
    nearest to $$w_1$$.

-   The dot product is calculated through matrix multiplication, as
    explained in previous modules.

-   The term "Softmax" refers to the transformation of the actual
    distances (dot products) into probabilities. It works similarly to
    logistic regression.

## Softmax in PyTorch for Classification

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the Softmax function in
PyTorch for classification tasks. The essential steps for performing any
kind of classification in PyTorch are as follows:

1.  **Load Data**: Load the dataset you want to work with. We'll be
    using the MNIST dataset as an example.

2.  **Create Model**: Define your classification model. In this case,
    we'll use the Softmax classifier.

3.  **Train Model**: Train the model on the training data.

4.  **View Results**: Evaluate the model by using it to classify test
    data (in this example, we use the validation dataset as our test
    data).

Let's dive into these steps:

### Load Data

First, you need to load your data. Import the necessary modules,
including `torch` and `torchvision` for working with datasets. We'll
load the MNIST dataset, which provides training and validation datasets
for our classification task.

``` python
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torchvision.datasets as datasets

transform = transforms.ToTensor()

train_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, transform=transform, download=True)
valid_dataset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, transform=transform)
```

The training dataset is specified with `train=True`, and the images are
loaded as PyTorch tensors using `transforms.ToTensor()`. The validation
dataset is used as our test dataset.

### Create Model

In this case, we create a Softmax classifier. Since the MNIST images are
28x28 pixels, we concatenate them to a 1D vector of 784 dimensions.
Since there are 10 possible output classes (digits 0-9), the output
dimension is 10.

The Softmax classifier uses parameter vectors for classification. We
have 10 weight parameters and 10 bias parameters, each with 784
dimensions.

### Loss Criterion

We specify the loss criterion function as cross-entropy loss. When using
this loss criterion, PyTorch will automatically perform Softmax
classification.

``` python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

### Optimizer

Define an optimizer for training the model, just like you did for
logistic regression. Additionally, you can set parameters to keep track
of the number of epochs and correctly/incorrectly classified samples.

### DataLoader

Create data loaders for training and validation. Specify batch sizes as
needed.

### Training the Model

Train the model using a series of epochs. The code for training is
similar to what you've used before, with the exception of the `view`
method to reshape the data.

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model, you can use the validation dataset (which is
technically our test data) to obtain results. By calculating the
accuracy of your model's predictions, you can assess its performance.

After training, you will notice that the weights of the Softmax
classifier start resembling the output classes (numbers 0 to 9) since
they have been learned during the training process.

This tutorial outlines the steps for using the Softmax function in
PyTorch for classification tasks, particularly focusing on the MNIST
dataset as an example. It covers loading data, creating the
classification model, training the model, and evaluating its results.

## What's a Neural Network

In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of neural networks using
an example with one hidden layer. Here's what we will cover:

1.  **Introduction to Neural Networks with One Hidden Layer featuring
    Two Neurons.**
2.  **Creating a Neural Network with One Hidden Layer using
    `nn.Module`.**
3.  **Creating a Neural Network with One Hidden Layer using
    `nn.Sequential`.**
4.  **Training the Neural Network model.**

### Introduction to Neural Networks

A neural network is a mathematical function used to approximate most
functions using a set of parameters. We'll understand this through a
classification example.

Imagine a classification problem where we overlay colors over features.
Think of this as a decision function where when $y = 1$, the value is
mapped to 1 on the vertical axis. We can represent this decision
function as a box.

### Building a Neural Network

Sometimes, using a straight line doesn't suffice to separate data, and
we need more complex decision boundaries. This is where neural networks
come in.

-   Each neuron or node in a neural network can be seen as a linear
    classifier.
-   We use an activation function, typically the sigmoid function, to
    transform the linear output.

We'll build a neural network with hidden layers and understand how it
approximates decision functions.

### Key Components of a Neural Network

-   **Linear Function:** Represents the weights and biases.
-   **Activation Function:** Sigmoid function to introduce
    non-linearity.
-   **Artificial Neurons:** Each combination of linear and activation
    functions.

### Neural Network Layers

A neural network with multiple layers can be visualized as nodes and
edges:

-   We apply a linear function to the input $x$.
-   Then, we pass the output through the sigmoid or activation function.
-   The second linear function is applied to the activation outputs.
-   By combining activations, we can approximate decision functions.

### Visualizing the Process

-   The neural network output of each component can be visualized.
-   Linear function output is a 2D plane, but activations separate data.
-   We get outputs that help make classifications and approximations.

### Building a Neural Network in PyTorch

-   We import necessary libraries, including `torch` and `nn`.
-   We create a neural network class, "net," with multiple layers using
    the `nn.Module`.
-   Input and output dimensions are specified for the layers.

### Interpretation with Matrix Multiplication

-   We can interpret the neural network as performing matrix
    multiplications.
-   Each linear layer corresponds to a matrix operation.

### Using `nn.Sequential`

-   The same neural network can be built using `nn.Sequential`, a faster
    way.
-   We add layers sequentially, including the activation functions.

### Training the Model

-   Training a neural network is similar to logistic regression.
-   We create data, loss functions, the model, and an optimizer.
-   The model parameters are trained iteratively to minimize the loss.

In summary, this tutorial gives an overview of neural networks,
including their components, how they approximate decision functions, and
how to create and train neural network models using PyTorch.
Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for deep learning
and practical machine learning applications.

## More Hidden Neurons

We explore how adding more neurons to the hidden layer of a neural
network can enhance model flexibility. We will review the process of
creating a neural network with more hidden neurons using `nn.Module` and
`nn.Sequential` in PyTtorch.

### The Need for More Neurons

-   Consider a dataset with samples that are not well-classified by the
    current decision function.
-   Adjusting the function by shifting or scaling does not help.
-   The model lacks flexibility to capture complex patterns in the data.
-   The solution is to add more neurons to the hidden layer to introduce
    additional functions.

### Symbolic Representation

-   Symbolically, we look at the activations of neurons.
-   Multiply the activations by their respective weights and sum them.
-   This process creates a combination of functions.

### Visual Representation

-   Visualizing the process, we start with a set of neurons.
-   The output of each neuron is multiplied by its weight to create
    sigmoid functions.
-   We add the output of these functions together.
-   Repeating this for multiple neurons results in a combined function.

### Scaling Issue

-   The combined function might have the correct shape but the vertical
    axis is off.
-   Applying the sigmoid function resolves the scaling problem.
-   The result is a suitable function for classifying the data.

### Building the Network with PyTorch

To build this network in PyTorch, follow these steps:

1.  Import the necessary libraries.
2.  Create a class for obtaining the dataset.
3.  Create a class for building the neural network model.
4.  Create a training function that iteratively accumulates the loss to
    obtain the cost.
5.  The training process is similar to logistic regression.
6.  Create a Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss.
7.  Create a dataset and a training loader.
8.  Define the neural network model, specifying the number of neurons in
    the hidden layer (e.g., 6 or 7).
9.  Create an optimizer, such as the Adam optimizer.
10. Train the model.

### Using `nn.Sequential` Module

-   For more accurate predictions, add 7 neurons to the hidden layer.
-   When visualizing the model along with the training points, observe
    that the model makes accurate predictions for the training data.

Adding more neurons to the hidden layer increases model flexibility,
allowing it to better fit complex data patterns. This flexibility can
significantly improve the model's performance in various machine
learning tasks.

## Neural Networks with Multiple Dimensional Input

In this tutorial, we explore neural networks that accept
multidimensional input data, with a focus on the case where the input is
two-dimensional. We will cover constructing networks with
multiple-dimensional input in PyTorch and address the concepts of
overfitting and underfitting.

### Expanding Input Dimensions

When dealing with more complex data, we can increase the dimensionality
of the input. This allows neural networks to capture more intricate
patterns. To illustrate this, consider the following diagram:

-   By increasing the input dimensions, the neural network can have more
    weights between the input layer and the hidden layer.
-   The diagram shows two-dimensional input data points represented in
    blue for class 0 and red for class 1.

### Non-Linear Classification

In the context of binary classification, it's clear that simple linear
boundaries are insufficient. To address this, more complex decision
boundaries are introduced. The result is non-linear classification,
which can be seen as follows:

-   Each colored region represents the output of the function for
    different input regions.
-   If the point falls in the red region, the function outputs 1; if
    it's in the blue region, the function outputs 0.

### Increasing Network Complexity

To handle non-linear classification, the neural network should have
sufficient complexity. Adding more hidden neurons to the network results
in a more powerful function. Here's how this can be represented:

-   In the example of three neurons, regions are clearly separated
    between class 0 and class 1.
-   With the addition of a fourth neuron, the classification becomes
    even more accurate.

### Visualizing in Higher Dimensions

To better understand the problem and visualize it, you can add an extra
dimension to represent the predicted output, creating a
three-dimensional surface.

-   The surface is a visual representation of the decision boundaries.
-   It shows a boundary at y-hat = 0 in the blue region and y-hat = 1 in
    the red region.

### Constructing Networks with Multiple Dimensional Input in PyTorch

When dealing with multiple-dimensional input in PyTorch, you will need
to import relevant libraries and create a dataset class as shown in the
video. The training process is similar to logistic regression for
single-dimensional data, but you need to specify the input dimensions
and the number of neurons in the hidden layers.

### Overfitting and Underfitting

**Overfitting** occurs when the model is too complex for the data, often
due to too many neurons in the hidden layer. Conversely,
**underfitting** happens when the model is too simple to capture the
data's complexity, typically because of too few neurons in the hidden
layer.

To mitigate overfitting and underfitting, you can: - Use validation data
to find the optimal number of neurons, striking a balance between too
many and too few. - Consider obtaining more data. - Utilize
regularization techniques.

## Multi-Class Neural Networks in PyTorch

In this tutorial, we'll explore the concepts of Multi-Class Neural
Networks and how to implement them in PyTorch.

### Multi-Class Classification

To perform multi-class classification in PyTorch, you need to set the
number of output neurons in the neural network's output layer to match
the number of classes in your classification problem. Each neuron in the
output layer corresponds to a unique class and has its own set of
parameters.

Mathematically, for a neural network with $M$ output classes, we
represent it as follows:

$$\[
\begin{align*}
y_0 &= X \cdot W_0 + b_0 \\
y_1 &= X \cdot W_1 + b_1 \\
&\vdots \\
y_{M-1} &= X \cdot W_{M-1} + b_{M-1}
\end{align*}
\]$$

Where: - $$\(y_i\)$$ is the output for the $i$-th class. - $$\(X\)$$
represents the input. - $$\(W_i\)$$ is the parameter matrix for the
$i$-th class. - $$\(b_i\)$$ is the bias term for the $$\(i\)$$-th class.

The operation for making predictions in multi-class neural networks is
similar to using the Softmax function, as we discussed in previous
modules.

### Making Predictions

To make predictions for a given input, we compute the output for each
class and select the class corresponding to the neuron with the largest
output. For example, if neuron $2$ has the highest value, the output of
our model is class $2$.

### Neural Network Implementation

In PyTorch, creating a multi-class neural network is straightforward.
The class for constructing a neural network is similar to what we used
previously. The key modification is setting the number of neurons in the
output layer to match the number of classes in the problem. We also omit
the activation function in the last layer.

The neural network structure is as follows: - The input dimension is
determined by the number of input features. - The hidden dimension
specifies the number of neurons in the hidden layer. - The output
dimension is the number of classes in the output.

You can define the neural network using the `nn.Sequential` module,
specifying the input dimension, hidden layer size, and output dimension.

### MNIST Dataset Example

In the lab, we often use the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten
digits from 0 to 9. The target variable, denoted as $y$, represents the
known classes or labels, ranging from 0 to 9. Images of handwritten
digits are converted to tensors with 784 dimensions (28x28 pixels).

The training function calculates the training loss for each iteration
and evaluates the accuracy on the validation data for each epoch.
Misclassified samples can be identified and printed out, providing
insights into the model's performance.

While the example demonstrates the output layer with a single set of
output neurons, you can add more hidden layers to create more complex
networks. However, be aware that training such networks can be more
challenging.

## Backpropagation

In this section, we'll delve into the concept of backpropagation,
focusing on a simple toy example. We'll also discuss the issue of the
vanishing gradient. While there's a fair amount of mathematics involved,
the key takeaways are as follows:

1.  Backpropagation significantly reduces the number of computations
    required to calculate gradients.
2.  We'll explore the problem of vanishing gradients that arises with
    certain activation functions in deep neural networks.

### Chain Rule in Backpropagation

The chain rule forms the foundation of backpropagation, enabling the
efficient calculation of gradients in neural networks. It states that
the derivative of the final output with respect to an initial parameter
is the product of derivatives at each intermediate step. This concept is
visualized as interconnected gears in the context of neural networks.

Let $$\( A \)$$ represent the final output, $$\( Z \)$$ an intermediate
parameter, and $$\( X \)$$ the initial parameter.

The chain rule equation: $$\[
\frac{dA}{dX} = \frac{dA}{dZ} \cdot \frac{dZ}{dX}
\]$$

### Toy Example: One Hidden Layer

In a simple neural network with one hidden layer and one output layer,
we aim to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to the
network's parameters. Key terms are represented using the chain rule.
While we present the exact equations here, the focus is on understanding
the underlying concept.

-   Derivative of Output Layer Parameters: To compute the gradient of
    the output layer parameters, we find the derivative of the loss
    function with respect to the activation in the output layer. This
    involves a series of derivatives as we move backward through the
    network layers.

The derivative of output layer parameters with respect to output
activation: $$\[
\frac{\partial \text{Output Parameters}}{\partial \text{Output Activation}} = \frac{\partial \text{Loss}}{\partial \text{Output Activation}}
\]$$

-   Derivative of Hidden Layer Parameters: Calculating the gradient of
    the hidden layer parameters involves a similar chain of derivatives
    but requires different intermediate values. As we backtrack through
    the layers, the computation becomes more intricate.

The equation for the derivative of hidden layer parameters: $$\[
\frac{\partial \text{Hidden Parameters}}{\partial \text{Hidden Activation}} = \frac{\partial \text{Loss}}{\partial \text{Output Activation}} \cdot \frac{\partial \text{Output Activation}}{\partial \text{Hidden Input}} \cdot \frac{\partial \text{Hidden Input}}{\partial \text{Hidden Parameters}}
\]$$

### Scaling to Deeper Networks

In deeper neural networks with multiple layers, the computational
complexity and potential for the vanishing gradient problem become
apparent. The vanishing gradient issue arises when gradients become very
small as they propagate backward through the network. This occurs when
activation functions yield derivatives less than one for typical inputs,
leading to extremely small products in the chain rule. Consequently, the
gradient diminishes as we backtrack, impeding parameter updates.

### Overcoming the Vanishing Gradient

To mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, one can explore alternative
activation functions or optimization methods that alleviate this effect.
Fortunately, frameworks like PyTorch handle these complexities,
automatically computing gradients using the backward method.

## Activation Functions

In this tutorial, we will explore commonly used activation functions in
neural networks, namely the Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU activation
functions, and learn how to implement them in PyTorch.

### Sigmoid Activation Function

The Sigmoid activation function is defined by the mathematical formula:

$$
\text{Sigmoid}(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

This function has an upper bound of 1 and a lower bound of 0. However,
it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, as its derivative is
close to zero for both very small and very large input values. This
issue can adversely affect backpropagation during training.

### Tanh Activation Function

The Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent) activation function is defined as:

$$\[
\text{Tanh}(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}
\]$$

It has an upper bound of 1 and a lower bound of -1, making it
zero-centered. While it performs better than the Sigmoid, it also
suffers from the vanishing gradient problem.

### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) Activation Function

The ReLU activation function is defined as follows:

$$\[
\text{ReLU}(z) = \begin{cases}
z, & \text{if } z > 0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]$$

It is zero when the input is less than zero and equal to the input when
it's greater than zero. The derivative of ReLU is 1 for positive inputs
and 0 for negative inputs, providing a partial solution to the vanishing
gradient problem.

### Visual Comparison

Here is a visual comparison of these activation functions, highlighting
their characteristics and gradients:

**Sigmoid Function:** - Upper bound: 1 - Lower bound: 0 - Vanishing
gradient issue

**Tanh Function:** - Upper bound: 1 - Lower bound: -1 - Zero-centered -
Vanishing gradient issue

**ReLU Function:** - Upper bound: None - Lower bound: 0 - Solves
vanishing gradient problem (for positive inputs)

### Implementing Activation Functions in PyTorch

You can implement these activation functions in PyTorch as follows:

-   Sigmoid:

``` python
# In the forward pass
output = torch.sigmoid(linear_output)
```

-   Tanh:

``` python
# In the forward pass
output = torch.tanh(linear_output)
```

-   ReLU:

``` python
# In the forward pass
output = torch.relu(linear_output)
```

By using these activation functions during the forward pass, you can
easily incorporate them into your neural network model.

### Performance Comparison

When comparing the performance of these activation functions on a neural
network model, ReLU and Tanh often outperform the Sigmoid function in
terms of training speed and validation accuracy.

# Module 5: Deep Neural Networks

## Deep Neural Networks

### Deep Neural Networks in PyTorch

In this tutorial, we'll explore deep neural networks with multiple
hidden layers and demonstrate how to implement them in PyTorch. Deep
neural networks play a crucial role in handling complex tasks and
learning from high-dimensional data.

### The Anatomy of a Deep Neural Network

Consider the following diagram of a deep neural network: - **D input
dimensions**: These represent the input features. - **Three neurons in
the first hidden layer**: Each neuron in this layer takes the D input
dimensions and processes them. - **Arbitrary number of neurons in the
output layer**: The output layer generates the network's final results.

Adding hidden layers to a neural network allows us to create more
complex decision functions, and deeper networks can capture intricate
patterns in data. However, deeper networks require careful tuning to
avoid overfitting.

### Building a Deep Neural Network in PyTorch

To create a deep neural network in PyTorch, we define a model with
multiple hidden layers and an output layer. The number of neurons in
each layer can vary. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to construct a
deep neural network:

1.  Define the model's architecture, specifying the input dimensions,
    number of neurons in each hidden layer, and the output dimension.
2.  Create a forward function that describes how data flows through the
    network.

In the forward function, you apply linear transformations followed by
activation functions to process the data: - For a deep neural network
with sigmoid activation, apply the sigmoid function to the output of
each layer. - For a deep neural network with tanh activation, use the
tanh function. - For a deep neural network with ReLU activation, apply
the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function.

You can create various deep neural network architectures with different
activation functions depending on the problem you're solving.

### Practical Example

Let's look at a practical example of training a deep neural network with
the MNIST dataset for digital recognition. Here's what we do: 1. Create
a validation and training dataset. 2. Set up a validation and training
loader to load the data. 3. Use the cross-entropy function for the loss.
4. In the training function, store the loss and validation accuracy. 5.
Construct a deep neural network model with specific input dimensions,
hidden layers, and output neurons. 6. Utilize the Stochastic Gradient
Descent optimizer for training.

In the lab, we'll explore deep neural network models with various
activation functions, including sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU. We'll evaluate
their performance in terms of loss and validation accuracy to understand
how different activation functions impact training.

You can continue to experiment by adding more hidden layers to build
even deeper neural networks for more complex tasks.

## Deep Neural Networks with `nn.ModuleList()`

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create deep neural networks in
PyTorch using `nn.ModuleList()`. This technique allows us to automate
the process of building neural networks with an arbitrary number of
layers, making it more efficient and flexible.

### Network Configuration

First, we need to define the configuration of our deep neural network.
We'll use a list called `layers` to specify the number of neurons in
each layer, including the input and output layers. The elements of this
list represent the layer sizes in sequence. For example, the first
element is the input feature size (e.g., 2), the second element is the
number of neurons in the first hidden layer (e.g., 3), and so on. The
last element indicates the number of classes in the output layer (e.g.,
3).

$$
\text{layers} = [2, 3, 4, 3]
$$

### Building the Network

We'll use `nn.ModuleList()` to create our deep neural network model in
the constructor of our custom module. This module list will store the
layers of our network. In this section, we'll show how to construct the
layers automatically based on the `layers` list.

``` python
class DeepNeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, layers):
        super(DeepNeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        
        for i in range(len(layers) - 1):
            input_size, output_size = layers[i], layers[i + 1]
            self.layers.append(nn.Linear(input_size, output_size))
```

This code iterates through the `layers` list and creates linear layers
for each specified layer size. This automated approach allows us to
construct deep neural networks with an arbitrary number of layers based
on the `layers` list.

### Forward Pass

The forward pass of the network iterates through its layers, applying
linear transformations followed by activation functions. We use ReLU
(Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions, as they are commonly used
in deep learning. This process continues until we reach the last layer.

$$
\text{forward function: } x^{(l+1)} = \text{ReLU}(W^{(l)} \cdot x^{(l)} + b^{(l)})
$$

For multiclass classification, we simply apply a linear layer for the
output layer. The output size of this layer corresponds to the number of
classes. In our example, we have three classes, so we have three output
neurons.

$$
\text{output size: } 3
$$

### Training Procedure

The training procedure for this deep neural network is similar to
previous sections. We can utilize different combinations of neurons and
layer numbers to find the configuration that yields the best performance
for our specific task.

This automated approach simplifies the process of creating deep neural
networks with varying architectures, allowing for more efficient
experimentation and model development.

## Dropout

In this section, we will delve into the dropout method, a technique
employed to enhance the performance of deep neural networks. Dropout is
primarily used to mitigate overfitting, ensuring that our model
generalizes well to unseen data. We will explore how to implement
dropout in PyTorch.

### Introduction

In reality, data is seldom perfectly separable by a clean decision
boundary. Noise and variations exist, making it challenging to train an
ideal model. Moreover, striking the right balance between the number of
model parameters (neurons, layers, etc.) is non-trivial. Too few, and we
risk underfitting; too many, and overfitting becomes a concern. Manual
experimentation to find the optimal architecture is both time-consuming
and resource-intensive.

A solution to this conundrum is to initiate with a complex model and
apply a form of regularization called dropout. Dropout is a popular
technique designed exclusively for neural networks. It encompasses two
phases: the training phase, where we implement dropout to improve
generalization, and the evaluation phase, where dropout is turned off to
assess the model's performance. The essence of dropout lies in the
manipulation of activation functions using Bernoulli random variables. A
Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution, with a
random variable 'r' that takes the value 0 with probability 'p' and the
value 1 with probability '1 - p'. This probabilistic dropout process
aids in preventing overfitting.

### Dropout Implementation

-   During training, in each layer of the neural network, we apply
    dropout by element-wise multiplication with a Bernoulli-distributed
    random variable 'r'. Each 'r' can either be 0 (neuron turned off)
    with probability 'p' or 1 (neuron active) with probability '1 - p'.

-   Bernoulli distribution helps stochastically turn off neurons
    independently in each layer. This randomness prevents co-adaptation
    of neurons, which is a leading cause of overfitting.

-   PyTorch automatically normalizes the values during the training
    phase by dividing them by '1 - p' to compensate for the expected
    value of each neuron that remains active.

-   The value of 'p' is a hyperparameter and should be selected
    carefully. Smaller 'p' values result in more aggressive dropout,
    potentially causing underfitting. Larger 'p' values are more lenient
    and might lead to overfitting.

### Evaluation Phase

During evaluation, we disable dropout by not applying the Bernoulli
random variable 'r'. The model is tested with all neurons active, which
ensures robust predictions.

### Dropout in PyTorch

In PyTorch, dropout is seamlessly integrated into your neural network
model. You specify the dropout probability 'p' as a parameter. A dropout
layer is added in between the hidden layers.

Here's how you implement dropout in PyTorch:

``` python
import torch.nn as nn

# Create your neural network model with dropout
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, p=0.5):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.drop = nn.Dropout(p)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, num_neurons1)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(num_neurons1, num_neurons2)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(num_neurons2, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.drop(x)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.drop(x)
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Instantiate your model
model = NeuralNetwork(p=0.5)

# Training phase
model.train()

# Evaluation phase
model.eval()
```

In this way, you control dropout during training and evaluation by
changing the mode of your model using `model.train()` and
`model.eval()`. When in evaluation mode, dropout is automatically turned
off, ensuring consistent model behavior.

### Conclusion

Dropout is a valuable tool to improve neural network generalization. It
helps strike the right balance between model complexity and overfitting.
By implementing dropout in your PyTorch models, you can achieve better
results with your deep learning tasks.

**Mathematics:**

During training, dropout is applied by element-wise multiplication of
the activation with a Bernoulli random variable 'r', which is a binary
variable (0 or 1) with a probability 'p' of being 0. This has the effect
of "turning off" some neurons during training, adding a layer of
stochasticity and regularization to the model.

-   Activation with dropout:
    $A_i^{(l)} = R_i^{(l)} \cdot \sigma(Z_i^{(l)})$
    -   Where $A_i^{(l)}$ is the activation of neuron $i$ in layer $l$.
    -   $R_i^{(l)}$ is the Bernoulli random variable indicating whether
        neuron $i$ is active (1) or turned off (0) with probability $p$.
    -   $\sigma(Z_i^{(l)})$ is the sigmoid activation function applied
        to the weighted sum $Z_i^{(l)}$ for neuron $i$.

**Code:**

``` python
import torch.nn as nn

# Create your neural network model with dropout
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, p=0.5):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.drop = nn.Dropout(p)
        # Define your layers
        # ...
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.drop(x)
        # Apply activation functions and layers
        # ...
        return x

# Instantiate your model
model = NeuralNetwork(p=0.5)

# Training phase
model.train()

# Evaluation phase
model.eval()
```

## Neural Network Weight Initialization

Neural network weight initialization plays a crucial role in the
successful training of neural network models. Incorrect weight
initialization can lead to issues such as vanishing gradients, which
hinder model convergence and performance. In this note, we'll explore
the problem of improper weight initialization and various methods to
address it.

**The Problem of Incorrect Weight Initialization**

Many neural network issues can be traced back to improper weight
initialization. If all the weights in a layer have the same values,
problems can arise. PyTorch typically initializes weights randomly using
a method we'll discuss later. However, to understand why this is
essential, let's investigate what happens when we initialize all weights
with the same value of 1 and bias to 0.

Consider a simple classification problem, and we start with these weight
parameters. After training the model, if we examine the weights, we may
find that the weights in the same layer have the same values. This can
be problematic because all neurons in that layer will have the same
output and, therefore, the same gradient updates. It is crucial to avoid
this, so random weight initialization is recommended.

**Correct Weight Initialization**

The key to addressing this issue is to randomly initialize the weight
parameters. We typically do this by sampling from a uniform distribution
with a specified range. The choice of the range is crucial. If the range
is too narrow, such as -0.05 to 0.05, the sampled values become
clustered, defeating the purpose of randomness. On the other hand, an
excessively wide range can lead to issues due to large weight values,
potentially causing vanishing gradients.

To address this, the distribution's width should be scaled inversely
with the number of input neurons. This scaling ensures that the maximum
sampled value doesn't become too large, preventing vanishing gradient
problems. For example, with 2 neurons, we scale by one-half, limiting
the maximum value to 0.5.

**Different Initialization Methods in PyTorch**

1.  **Default Method**: In PyTorch, when using the `nn.Linear` layer
    with `L_in` input neurons, the default initialization ranges from
    `-1/sqrt(L_in)` to `1/sqrt(L_in)`. This default initialization
    method is suitable for many scenarios.

2.  **Xavier Initialization**: Xavier Initialization, often used with
    the tanh activation function, considers both the number of input
    neurons (`L_in`) and the number of neurons in the next layer
    (`L_out`). The range is calculated as per this method and can be
    applied to weights using the `xavier_uniform_` function.

3.  **He Initialization**: He Initialization is designed for the ReLU
    activation function. It involves initializing weights using the
    method and can be applied in PyTorch using the `he_uniform_`
    function.

In practice, comparing different weight initialization methods on a
validation dataset's accuracy can help choose the most suitable method
for your specific neural network.

In summary, proper weight initialization is essential to avoid issues
like vanishing gradients. The choice of initialization method should be
based on the activation function used and the architecture of your
neural network. It's an important step in ensuring your neural network
learns effectively and converges to desired results.

## Gradient Descent with Momentum

### Introduction

Gradient Descent with Momentum is a technique used to overcome problems
like getting stuck in saddle points and local minima during the
optimization of parameters. It leverages the concepts of position,
velocity, and acceleration similar to those in physics.

### Momentum in Physics

In physics, an object's position (x) can be described by its velocity
(v) and acceleration (a). These concepts are analogous to the
parameters, gradient, and update rule in gradient descent.

$$x^0 = 0$$

-   Initial position (position at time t=0): x\^0 = 0

If the object accelerates with an acceleration (a) for a period of time
(t), we can calculate the new position:

$$x^1 = x^0 + v^0*t + 0.5*a*t^2$$

-   New position (position at time t): x\^1

### Velocity

Velocity (v) represents the rate of change in position concerning time.
If velocity is constant:

$$v = \frac{x^1 - x^0}{t}$$

-   Velocity (v) at time t

### How Momentum Relates to Gradient Descent

In the context of gradient descent, we can use these physics concepts to
improve optimization:

-   Position (x) corresponds to the parameter we're optimizing.
-   Velocity (v) is analogous to the change in the parameter (parameter
    update).
-   Acceleration (a) relates to the gradient of the cost or loss
    function.

In the update rule for gradient descent with momentum:

-   Velocity at the k+1 iteration is the sum of the derivative of the
    cost with respect to the parameter (gradient) and the previous
    velocity scaled by the momentum term.

$$v^{k+1} = \rho*v^k + \frac{\partial J}{\partial w}$$

-   New parameter value (position) is updated by subtracting the
    learning rate (η) multiplied by the current velocity.

$$w^{k+1} = w^k - \eta*v^{k+1}$$

### Momentum in Optimization

Momentum in optimization is like mass in physics. When the mass (ρ) of
the object is small, the product of momentum and the previous velocity
is small. In the presence of a small gradient (force), the object won't
be stopped. With a larger mass (ρ), a relatively larger force (gradient)
is needed to stop the object. Similarly, in optimization, a larger
momentum term helps overcome saddle points and local minima, but it may
also risk overshooting the global minimum. Therefore, the momentum term
should be chosen wisely.

### Benefits of Momentum

Gradient Descent with Momentum helps overcome problems such as getting
stuck in saddle points and local minima. It allows the optimization
process to continue smoothly, even when gradients are small, by
incorporating the idea of momentum from physics.

### Practical Application

In PyTorch, you can use momentum by specifying the momentum value in the
parameters of the optimizer object. Experimenting with different
momentum values can help you avoid getting stuck in local minima and
accelerate convergence.

### Conclusion

Gradient Descent with Momentum uses concepts from physics to solve
optimization problems. By understanding the relationships between
position, velocity, and acceleration, you can better navigate and
optimize complex landscapes, including those with saddle points and
local minima.

# Module 6

## Convolution

### Introduction

IConcept of convolution, a fundamental operation in neural networks.
Convolution plays a crucial role in tasks like image processing,
allowing us to extract features and detect patterns. We'll explore what
convolution is, how to calculate the size of the activation map, the
role of the stride parameter, and the concept of zero padding.

### Understanding Convolution

Convolution in the context of neural networks involves looking at the
relative positions of pixels in an image rather than their absolute
positions. Imagine two identical images slightly shifted. When converted
to vectors, the intensity values appear in different locations.
Convolutional Networks address this by considering pixel positions
relative to each other.

### Convolution Operation

The convolution operation is analogous to a linear equation, resulting
in another matrix or tensor called an activation map. It is represented
as:

$$Z = (W * X) + b$$

Where: - Z: Output tensor (activation map) - W: Kernel (also known as a
filter) - X: Input tensor (image or feature map) - \*: Convolution
operation - b: Bias term

### Convolution Example

Let's go through an example of convolution using PyTorch. Consider an
input image with a size of 5x5 pixels and a single channel. The
convolution operation involves overlaying a 3x3 kernel over the image.
PyTorch initializes the kernel parameters randomly.

### Convolution Operation Steps

1.  Start at the top-right corner of the image.
2.  Overlay the kernel on that region.
3.  Multiply each element of the kernel by the corresponding element of
    the image and sum the results to get the first element of the
    activation map.
4.  Shift the kernel to the right by one column and repeat the
    operation, resulting in the second element of the activation map.
5.  Continue this process until the last element of the image is
    reached.

### Adding Bias

When adding the bias term, it is broadcasted to every element in the
activation map.

### Calculating Activation Map Size

To determine the size of the activation map, we can use the formula:

$$N = M - K + 1$$

Where: - N: Size of the activation map - M: Size of the input image - K:
Size of the kernel

### Stride Parameter

The stride parameter represents how much the kernel moves. With a stride
of 1, the kernel moves one step per iteration. You can set the stride
parameter when creating a convolution object.

### Handling Stride

The size of the activation map is determined by:

$$N = \frac{{M - K}}{S} + 1$$

Where: - S: Stride value

### Zero Padding

In cases where the stride might result in non-integer values, we can use
zero padding to ensure consistency. By adding extra rows and columns of
zeros to the input image, the size remains compatible with the desired
stride.

### Conclusion

Convolution is a fundamental operation used in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and perform various
tasks like image recognition. Understanding how convolution works,
calculating activation map sizes, and using stride and padding are key
concepts in building efficient CNNs.

## Activation Functions and Max Pooling

### Introduction

In this discussion, we'll explore activation functions and max pooling,
two essential concepts in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for
image processing. Activation functions add non-linearity to CNNs, while
max pooling helps reduce the spatial dimensions of activation maps.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions are critical in CNNs as they introduce
non-linearity. These functions are applied element-wise to the
activation map, ensuring that CNNs can learn complex patterns and
relationships within the data. The most common activation function is
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).

-   ReLU Activation: The ReLU function sets all negative values to zero,
    effectively removing negative responses from the activation map.

$$f(x) = \max(0, x)$$

-   Applying ReLU to the activation map zeros out negative values and
    retains or increases positive values. This process is performed
    independently for each element in the activation map.

### PyTorch Implementation

In PyTorch, you can apply activation functions after performing
convolution on an input image. For example, you can create a ReLU object
and apply it directly.

``` python
import torch.nn as nn

# Create a ReLU activation object
relu = nn.ReLU()

# Apply ReLU activation
output = relu(convolved_input)
```

### Max Pooling

Max pooling is a technique used to downsample the spatial dimensions of
activation maps. It helps in reducing the number of parameters, making
the network more computationally efficient and less prone to
overfitting. Max pooling is typically applied after convolution.

-   Max Pooling Operation: In max pooling, we define a region of pixels
    with a shape (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3). We then choose the maximum value
    within that region.

-   Sliding Window: Similar to convolution, we use a sliding window to
    move through the activation map. For each window, we select the
    maximum value.

### PyTorch Implementation

In PyTorch, you can apply max pooling using the MaxPool2d object,
specifying the region size and stride.

``` python
import torch.nn as nn

# Create a MaxPool2d object
max_pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)

# Apply max pooling to the activation map
output = max_pool(convolved_input)
```

### Benefits of Max Pooling

Max pooling helps in reducing the impact of small changes in the image.
For example, when dealing with two identical images that are slightly
shifted, max pooling ensures that the output remains identical after
processing. It also reduces the spatial dimensions, making further
computations more efficient.

### Conclusion

Activation functions like ReLU and techniques such as max pooling play a
crucial role in enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of
convolutional neural networks. They make it possible to learn complex
patterns, reduce spatial dimensions, and enhance the overall performance
of CNNs when processing image data.

## Multiple Input and Output Channels

### Introduction

In this discussion, we'll delve into the fascinating world of
convolution with multiple channels. We'll explore the concepts of
multiple output channels, multiple input channels, and the combination
of both -- multiple input and output channels.

### Multiple Output Channels

When dealing with multiple output channels, we employ multiple kernels,
each producing a distinct activation map. These activation maps
collectively provide different insights into the input data. The process
is as follows:

1.  Define a convolutional object, specifying the number of output
    channels (e.g., three).
2.  Create an input image, with parameters representing the number of
    images (mini-batch size) and the number of channels.
3.  Perform convolution using the multiple kernels, resulting in
    separate output channels labeled Z0, Z1, and Z2.

For each output channel, the kernel acts as a feature detector,
recognizing specific patterns in the input. For example, one kernel
might detect vertical lines, another horizontal lines, and the third
could identify corners or edges.

### Multiple Input Channels

Multiple input channels typically occur in scenarios such as RGB images,
where each channel corresponds to a different color component. In such
cases, we perform separate convolutions for each input channel using its
own kernel. The results are then summed to produce a single output. The
operation is analogous to a dot product between a row vector of
parameters (kernels) and a column vector of input values (image).

### Multiple Input and Output Channels

When working with both multiple input and output channels, the
complexity increases. Here's how it works:

1.  Create a convolution object with multiple input channels and
    multiple output channels.
2.  Each output channel consists of two sets of kernels, one for each
    input channel.
3.  Convolution is performed for each input and corresponding kernel
    set.
4.  The results of these operations are added together to produce the
    final output.

Visualize this as a matrix multiplication, with the kernels represented
as matrix elements. The number of inputs corresponds to the number of
columns, and the number of outputs equates to the number of rows.

### The Mathematical Expression

For a multi-channel convolution, you can refer to the formula:

$$Z_{L}^{k} = \sum_{K} X^{K} * W_{L}^{k} + b_L$$

Where: - $Z_{L}^{k}$ represents the output in the L-th channel. -
$X^{K}$ is the input in the K-th channel. - $W_{L}^{k}$ is the kernel in
the L-th output channel and K-th input channel. - $b_L$ is the bias term
for the L-th output channel.

### Practical Application

In real-world applications, PyTorch randomly initializes kernels.
However, in practice, you can specify custom kernel values for better
control. Multiple input and output channels are instrumental in
enhancing the ability of convolutional neural networks to extract
intricate features from complex data.

### Conclusion

Understanding the intricacies of multiple input and output channels in
convolution is crucial for advanced image processing tasks. These
techniques empower neural networks to discern various patterns, leading
to more effective image analysis and interpretation.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

### Introduction to CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep
learning models designed to process structured grid data, such as images
or other grid data. In this discussion, we will explore the fundamental
components of CNNs: The CNN Constructor, Forward Step, and Training in
PyTorch.

### CNN Structure

CNNs are typically illustrated as multi-layered networks. These layers
include convolutional layers, activation maps, pooling layers, and fully
connected layers. Each component plays a specific role in extracting
features and making predictions.

### Building a Simple CNN

To better understand CNNs, let's create a simple example. We want to
distinguish between a horizontal line (Y = 1) and a vertical line (Y =
0) in noisy images. Our CNN will consist of two convolution layers and
an output layer.

### First Convolution Layer

1.  Input Image (X) is fed into the first convolutional layer.
2.  The convolution operation is applied, resulting in two activation
    maps.
3.  Activation functions are applied to each activation map.
4.  Max-pooling is performed, generating two outputs.

### Second Convolution Layer

1.  The outputs from the first layer serve as inputs.
2.  Two kernels are used for convolution.
3.  Convolution and activation functions are applied.
4.  Another max-pooling layer reduces the output to one activation map.

### Flattening and Fully Connected Layers

1.  The final activation map is flattened or reshaped.
2.  The 1D tensor is used as input for a fully connected neural network.
3.  The fully connected layer classifies the input.

### CNN Constructor

The CNN constructor involves defining the layers and their parameters.
For instance, we specify the number of output channels for the first and
second convolution layers, kernel sizes, padding sizes, max-pooling
kernel sizes, and stride sizes.

### Forward Method

In the forward step, we apply convolution operations, activation
functions, and max-pooling sequentially. We reshape the output from the
second max-pooling layer, preparing it for the fully connected layer.

### Training in PyTorch

To train a CNN in PyTorch, we need a dataset, a loss criterion, an
optimizer, and training parameters. Data is loaded into a training and
validation loader, and the model is trained using backpropagation. As
the cost decreases during training, the accuracy of the model on the
validation data increases.

### Conclusion

Convolutional Neural Networks are powerful tools for image processing
and structured grid data analysis. By understanding their structure,
constructors, forward steps, and training processes, we can leverage
CNNs for various applications, from image classification to object
detection and more.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

### Introduction

In this note, we'll explore how to build a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) for the MNIST dataset. To expedite the process in the lab, we will
work with smaller 16x16 images instead of the standard MNIST 28x28
images. This allows us to understand the structure of the CNN more
quickly.

### CNN Architecture

Our CNN will consist of two convolutional layers and a final output
layer. Here's an overview of the architecture: - The first convolutional
layer has a kernel size of 5x5, a padding of 2, and 16 output
channels. - The second convolutional layer has 16 input channels from
the previous layer and produces 32 output channels. It also has a kernel
size of 5x5, stride size of 1, and padding of 2. - We use max-pooling
layers (maxpool1 and maxpool2) to reduce spatial dimensions. - The final
output layer maps the 512 output elements from the previous layers to 10
neurons, corresponding to the 10 classes in MNIST.

### Constructor and Forward Method

The CNN follows a structure similar to a simple CNN but with more
channels in each layer. Here's a breakdown of the constructor and
forward method:

### Constructor

1.  We create a 2D convolution object (`cnn1`) with the properties:
    kernel size of 5, padding of 2, and 16 output channels.
2.  We add a max-pooling object (`maxpool1`) with a kernel size of 2 and
    default stride.
3.  The second convolution layer (`cnn2`) has 16 input channels and 32
    output channels, with a kernel size of 5, stride of 1, and padding
    of 2.
4.  We add a second max-pooling layer (`maxpool2`).
5.  The final output layer maps the 512 elements from the previous
    layers to 10 neurons.

### Forward Method

1.  Apply the first 2D convolution (`cnn1`) followed by an activation
    function and max-pooling.
2.  Apply the second convolution layer (`cnn2`) followed by activation
    and max-pooling.
3.  Flatten or reshape the output channels.
4.  Apply the output layer for classification.

### Output Layer Shape

The output from the max-pooling step is a tensor of shape 4x4 for each
of the 32 channels, totaling 512 elements. As there are 10 classes in
MNIST, each neuron in the output layer receives 512 input dimensions.

### Conclusion

This CNN architecture is designed for image classification tasks like
MNIST. The two convolutional layers help extract features from the
input, and the final output layer produces predictions for the 10
classes. This architecture can be further customized and extended for
more complex tasks.

## GPU in PyTorch

### Introduction

This guide will explain how to harness the power of Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) in PyTorch. We'll cover key aspects like CUDA, CPUs,
tensors, setting up the GPU, training, and testing with GPUs in PyTorch.

### Leveraging GPUs

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) significantly accelerate the execution
of machine learning models. In PyTorch, CUDA (Compute Unified Device
Architecture) is used to harness the potential of GPUs. CUDA is a
parallel computing platform developed by NVIDIA that empowers GPU-based
computational tasks, such as training Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) in PyTorch.

### Importing torch.cuda

To begin using GPUs in PyTorch, you need to import the necessary
packages. In PyTorch, the torch.cuda package allows for GPU-based
computation. By importing torch, you gain access to these GPU-related
functionalities.

### Checking for GPU Availability

To ensure that your system is equipped with a compatible GPU, you can
use the torch.cuda package to check for CUDA availability. This step is
essential to verify the presence of a functional GPU.

### Setting Up the GPU Device

Once CUDA availability is confirmed, you can designate the GPU you
intend to use. In PyTorch, cuda:0 represents the first available CUDA
device. Setting up the GPU device is a crucial step in the process.

### Computation with Tensors

Computation in PyTorch primarily revolves around tensors. These tensors
are used to store and manipulate data for training your CNNs. The
advantage of tensors is that they can be easily deployed on the GPU
using the `.to` method, facilitating device conversion.

### CNN Setup

When creating your Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), there's no need
to make adjustments to the `__init__` or `forward` functions. These
functions remain unchanged in your CNN code. An essential change occurs
after creating the CNN object. You must use the device set up earlier to
send your model to the GPU, achieved with the `.to` method. This action
converts the layers you've created within the `__init__` function into
CUDA tensors.

### Training and Testing

The training and testing processes on a GPU are quite similar to those
on a CPU. However, when utilizing a GPU, it's imperative to transfer
your data (features and labels) to the GPU. This ensures that the
computations during training and testing are performed on the GPU for
faster execution.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you've learned how to employ a GPU in PyTorch
to expedite computational tasks. Leveraging GPUs can significantly
enhance the performance and efficiency of your deep learning models.
