# Module 2: Supervised Learning Models

## Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

-   CNNs, or Convolutional Neural Networks, have gained significant attention in the machine learning community in recent years due to their wide range of applications, such as object detection and speech recognition.

-   Object recognition is a key application of CNNs, and they are adept at extracting elements from images, even when those elements are only partially visible, like chairs in an image.

-   CNNs were developed to address the challenge of forming the best possible representation of the visual world for recognition tasks. They needed to have two key features:

    1.  **Object Detection and Categorization:** Ability to detect objects in images and categorize them appropriately.

    2.  **Robustness:** Robustness against differences in pose, scale, illumination, occlusion, and clutter. This robustness was historically a limitation of hand-coded algorithms.

-   The solution to the object recognition challenge was inspired by the operation of the human visual cortex. CNNs operate hierarchically, starting with an input image, extracting primitive features, combining these features to form object parts, and finally assembling the parts to recognize the object.

-   CNNs learn features in a hierarchical manner. Simple features, such as edges, are detected in the first layer, and these features are combined to form more complex features in subsequent layers. This hierarchical approach allows CNNs to recognize objects like cats, dogs, or any other target object.

-   In the training phase, CNNs are exposed to many images of the target object (e.g., a building). They automatically learn that primitive features, like horizontal and vertical lines, are characteristic of the object. These simple features serve as the building blocks for more abstract components, such as windows or the overall shape of the building.

-   When CNNs see an image of the target object they haven't encountered before, they can make a decision about whether it's the target object based on the presence of the learned features.

-   CNNs are used not only for recognizing buildings but also for various objects like faces, animals, cars, and more.

-   CNNs consist of layers, each responsible for detecting a set of feature sets. These features become more abstract as the network progresses through subsequent layers.

-   In summary, CNNs are a powerful tool for object recognition, and their ability to automatically learn features and patterns from images makes them invaluable in a wide range of applications.

-   This introductory overview provides a basic understanding of the principles behind Convolutional Neural Networks and their potential applications.

## Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification

### CNN for Image Classification

-   CNNs excel at image classification, such as digit recognition.
-   Contrast between CNNs and traditional shallow neural networks.
-   In shallow networks, feature extraction is a crucial step, involving choosing and using image features like color, edges, pixel locations, etc.
-   The quality of feature selection significantly impacts the accuracy and efficiency of image classification.
-   However, the manual feature selection process is time-consuming and often ineffective.
-   Adapting selected features to different image types is challenging.

### CNN's Approach

-   CNNs address the feature extraction challenge by incorporating more hidden layers with specialized functions.
-   CNNs automatically discover and use relevant image features for classification.
-   Practical example: The MNIST dataset, which contains size-normalized and centered handwritten digits (0 to 9).
-   Objective: Build a digit recognition system using CNN for MNIST dataset.

### Deep Learning Pipeline

-   Deep learning process consists of three phases:
    1.  Pre-processing of input data.
    2.  Training the deep learning model.
    3.  Inference and deployment of the model.
-   Pre-processing converts images into a suitable format.
-   Training phase involves feeding a large dataset of images to an untrained network, enabling it to learn.
-   In this case, a CNN is trained with many hand-written images from the training set.
-   Trained model is used in the inference phase to classify new images, making it a deployable digit recognition model for unseen cases.

### Training Process

-   A deep neural network differs from shallow networks in terms of the number and type of layers.

-   Common CNN layer types include:

    -   Convolutional layers: Apply convolution operations and pass results to the next layer.
    -   Pooling layers: Combine outputs of neuron clusters in the previous layer into a single neuron.
    -   Fully connected layers: Connect every neuron in the previous layer to every neuron in the next layer.

-   CNN's layer architecture is more sophisticated and specialized for image recognition.

-   The next video will provide detailed information about these layers and their specifications.

-   This section explains the significance of CNNs in image classification, the contrast with shallow networks, and introduces the MNIST dataset as a practical example for digit recognition using CNNs. It also outlines the deep learning pipeline and the different types of layers involved in the training process.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Architecture

### CNN Architecture Overview

-   CNN is a neural network with specific hidden layers: convolutional, pooling, and fully connected.
-   Key layers:
    1.  **Convolutional Layer:** Detects patterns or features in an input image, such as edges.
    2.  **Pooling Layer:** Reduces dimensionality of activated neurons.
    3.  **Fully Connected Layer:** Converts filtered images into vectors for classification.

### Convolutional Layer

-   Convolutional layer's main purpose is to detect patterns in an image.
-   Example: Detecting edges in an image.
-   Use a filter (kernel) to slide over the image and apply dot products to create a new image with detected edges.
-   Convolution is a mathematical function used for detecting edges, orientations, and small patterns in images.
-   Mathematically, it's like a matrix multiplication of the image and the filter.
-   The result is one of the first feature sets in CNNs.

### Multiple Kernels

-   Apply multiple kernels to an image to detect various patterns such as edges, curves, etc.
-   Output of the convolution process is called a feature map.
-   Different kernels find different patterns.
-   During training, kernels are typically initialized with random values and updated for optimum digit recognition.

### ReLu Activation Function

-   Add activation functions to neurons to determine if they should fire.
-   Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) is a common activation function.
-   ReLu increases the non-linear properties of the decision function.
-   It replaces negative values with zero.

### Max Pooling

-   Max pooling reduces dimensionality and simplifies inputs.
-   Selects the maximum values in a matrix, reducing the number of parameters.
-   It turns low-level data into higher-level information.
-   Helps to reduce the dimension of activated neurons.

### Fully Connected Layer

-   Converts filtered images into vectors.
-   Each neuron in the previous layer is connected to all neurons in this layer.
-   Weights between the layers are learned during training.
-   ReLu activation is used in this layer.

### Softmax for Classification

-   Softmax is used for multi-class classification.
-   It generates probabilities for each class.
-   The class with the highest probability is the predicted class.
-   It outputs a multi-class categorical probability distribution.

### CNN Architecture

-   A typical CNN consists of layers for feature learning and extraction, followed by classification.
-   CNNs use multiple convolution, ReLu, and max-pooling operations.
-   Each pass through these operations reduces image dimensions and increases depth, breaking down complex patterns into simpler ones.
-   Trained CNNs can recognize patterns and features in images.

### Training CNNs

-   CNNs are feedforward neural networks with learnable weights and biases.
-   The network learns the connections between layers during training.
-   Weights are initialized randomly and updated using a dataset of images.
-   We check the output against the expected output and adjust the weights.
-   Training continues until the network achieves a high accuracy of prediction.

# Module 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## The Sequential Problem

### Overview of Sequential Data

-   Sequential data: Data where each point is dependent on other points.
-   Common examples: Time series data (e.g., stock prices), sensor data, sentences, gene sequences, weather data.
-   Traditional neural networks struggle with handling sequential data.

### Limitations of Traditional Neural Networks

-   Traditional feedforward neural networks are not suitable for sequential data analysis.
-   Consider a problem: Predicting daily weather (sunny or rainy) based on temperature and humidity.
-   Traditional neural networks process data point by point without remembering past data.
-   Each data point is considered independently, assuming no data dependencies.
-   For instance, a basic feedforward neural network processes input data and provides individual daily weather predictions, but it doesn't account for data correlations.

### The Problem with Data Dependencies

-   Weather example: Weather on one day often influences the weather on subsequent days.
-   Traditional neural networks overlook data dependencies and correlations.
-   They analyze each data point in isolation, which can be problematic when dealing with sequential data.
-   The lack of memory or context can lead to suboptimal or incorrect predictions.

### Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

-   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) address the limitations of traditional neural networks for sequential data.

-   RNNs are designed to handle sequential datasets effectively.

-   RNNs have a mechanism to maintain data dependencies and context, making them suitable for problems with temporal dependencies.

-   Understanding the limitations of traditional neural networks in handling sequential data highlights the need for specialized models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to address these challenges. RNNs provide a solution by preserving the context and dependencies in sequential datasets.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

### Overview of Recurrent Neural Networks

-   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data.
-   RNNs maintain a state or context, serving as a form of memory to remember previous analyses.
-   The state captures information from previous calculations and recurs back into the network with each new input.

### RNN Architecture

-   Imagine a simple RNN with just one hidden layer.
-   The first data point flows into the network as input data (X).
-   Hidden units receive the previous state (H_previous) and the input.
-   In the hidden layer, two values are calculated:
    -   The new or updated state (H_new), which will be used for the next data point in the sequence.
    -   The network's output (y).
-   The new state (H_new) depends on the previous state and the input data.

### Handling Initial State

-   If it's the first data point, an initial state is used.
-   The type of initial state depends on the specific data being analyzed, typically initialized to all zeros.

### Weight Matrices

-   The equations include weight matrices:
    -   Wx is the weight matrix between the input and the hidden unit.
    -   Wh are the weights multiplied by the previously hidden state in the equation.

### Repeating the Process

-   After processing the first data point and generating the output, a new context represents the most recent point.
-   This context is fed back into the network with the next data point, and the steps are repeated until all data is processed.

### Applications of RNNs

-   RNNs are versatile and used in various applications with sequential data:
    -   Speech recognition (many-to-many network).
    -   Image captioning (one-to-many network) for understanding image elements and forming captions.
    -   Many-to-one RNNs for predicting stock market prices or sentiment analysis.
-   RNNs can be many-to-many, one-to-many, or many-to-one, depending on the problem.
-   The video mentions only a few applications, but RNNs are used for increasingly complex problems beyond what's discussed.

### Challenges and Limitations

-   RNNs have challenges:
    -   Need to keep track of states, which can be computationally expensive.
    -   Sensitivity to changes in parameters, making training difficult.
    -   Issues with vanishing gradients (gradient nearly zero) and exploding gradients (gradient grows exponentially), affecting the model's learning capacity.
-   Despite challenges, RNNs remain a valuable tool for sequential data analysis.

## The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model

### Introduction to LSTM

-   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are suitable for modeling sequential data but face challenges at scale.
-   Issues include the computational cost of tracking states and problems with training, such as vanishing and exploding gradients.
-   Vanilla RNNs struggle with learning long sequences.
-   The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is a popular solution to these problems.

### LSTM Structure

-   LSTM maintains gradients over many time steps, enabling training with longer sequences.
-   An LSTM unit comprises four primary elements:
    -   Memory cell: Stores data.
    -   Write gate: Inputs data into the memory cell.
    -   Read gate: Retrieves data from the memory cell.
    -   Forget gate: Manages data in the memory cell, deciding what to forget.
-   Gates are operations in the LSTM that manipulate inputs, the network's previous hidden state, and previous output.
-   Gates allow the network to remember essential information and forget irrelevant data in a sequence.

### Data Flow in LSTM

-   Data passes through the LSTM recurrent network in a sequential manner.
-   In the first time step, the initial element of the sequence enters the network.
-   The LSTM unit uses its hidden state and output to produce the new hidden state and the output for the first step.
-   The output and hidden state are sent to the next time step, and the process continues for subsequent time steps.
-   The LSTM unit maintains two key pieces of information as it propagates through time:
    -   Hidden state: Accumulated memory through time.
    -   Previous time step output.

### Stacked LSTM Layers

-   Stacking LSTM layers allows for more complex feature representation and deeper model architecture.
-   In the case of stacked LSTM, the output of the first layer becomes the input for the second layer.
-   Each LSTM layer processes the input and blends it with its internal state to produce an output.
-   Stacking LSTM hidden layers increases model complexity and can lead to more accurate results.

### LSTM Training

-   During training, the network learns to determine how much old information to forget using the forget gate.

-   The network also learns the weights and biases for each gate in each layer.

-   Weights and biases include:

    -   WF (weights for forget gate)
    -   BF (biases for forget gate)
    -   Weights for the input gate
    -   Weights and biases for the new cell state
    -   Weights and biases for the output gate.

-   The network learns to manage and adjust these parameters through the training procedure.

-   In summary, LSTM is a powerful tool for processing sequential data, maintaining memory across time steps, and addressing the challenges faced by traditional RNNs.

### Mathematical Notation (LSTM Equations)

-   The mathematical equations describing LSTM are as follows:

1.  Memory cell update: $$C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t$$

2.  Hidden state update: $$h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)$$

3.  Forget gate: $$f_t = \sigma(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$

4.  Input gate: $$i_t = \sigma(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$$

5.  Candidate cell state: $$\tilde{C}_t = tanh(W_C * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$$

6.  Output gate: $$o_t = \sigma(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$$

-   Here, $C_t$ is the cell state at time $t$, $h_t$ is the hidden state at time $t$, and $x_t$ is the input at time $t$.
-   $f_t$, $i_t$, $\tilde{C}_t$, and $o_t$ represent the forget gate, input gate, candidate cell state, and output gate, respectively.
-   $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation function, and $tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.
-   $W$ and $b$ are weight matrices and biases for each gate.

## Language Modeling with LSTM

### Introduction

-   Language Modeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing.
-   It assigns probabilities to sequences of words.
-   For example, given the sequence "This is," a language model predicts the next word, such as "example."
-   Language Modeling is crucial for applications like speech recognition, machine translation, and image captioning.

### Language Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

-   Language Modeling is essentially a sequential data analysis problem.
-   The sequence of words provides context, and the most recent word is treated as input data.
-   RNNs, particularly LSTM, are well-suited for language modeling.

### LSTM for Language Modeling

-   An LSTM network can be used for language modeling.
-   A network may consist of two stacked LSTM units.
-   Training involves passing each word of a sentence to the network and generating an output word.
-   However, words cannot be directly fed to the network; they must be converted into numerical vectors using Word Embedding.

### Word Embedding

-   Word Embedding represents words as n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.
-   Vectors are typically of a fixed length, e.g., 200 dimensions.
-   Word Embedding encodes text into numerical representations.
-   These vectors are initially randomly initialized and updated during training based on context, creating similarity between words used in similar contexts.

### Using LSTM for Language Modeling

-   In a single sequence, 20 words are processed.
-   Vocabulary size is 10,000 words, and each word has a 200-dimensional embedding vector.
-   Two LSTM units with hidden sizes of 256 and 128 are used.
-   The second LSTM unit's output is a 20x128 matrix.
-   A softmax layer calculates the probability of the output words (a 10,000-dimensional vector).
-   The word with the highest probability is the predicted word.

### Training and Error Backpropagation

-   Training involves comparing the predicted sequence to the ground truth.
-   The network calculates a quantitative value, called the loss.
-   Errors are backpropagated into the network.
-   The following weights are updated during training:
    -   Embedding matrix
    -   Weight matrices related to LSTM gates
    -   Weights related to the softmax layer.

### Training with Batches

-   Instead of feeding one sequence at a time, batches of sequences are used to train the model.

-   Batches improve training efficiency and stability.

-   For example, a batch might contain 60 sentences.

-   In summary, LSTM networks, combined with Word Embedding, are powerful tools for language modeling, enabling the prediction of the most likely next word in a sequence.

# Module 4: Unsupervised Deep Learning Models

## Introduction to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

### Overview

-   Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are shallow neural networks with two layers: the visible layer and the hidden layer.
-   RBMs are unsupervised learning models used for finding patterns in data by reconstructing the input.

### Illustration with Movie Ratings

-   Consider a matrix of Netflix movie ratings, where rows represent movies, columns represent user ratings, and each cell contains a rating score.
-   The RBM has two layers: visible and hidden.
-   The network learns to reconstruct input vectors, making guesses about user preferences.
-   Users with similar preferences activate the same hidden units.
-   RBMs can be used for collaborative filtering, recommending unseen movies based on learned patterns.

### Structure of RBMs

-   RBMs have a visible layer (input) and a hidden layer.
-   They are "restricted" because neurons within the same layer are not connected.
-   RBMs learn weights when fed input data.
-   Values in the hidden layer serve as features learned automatically from the input data.
-   The hidden layer's smaller size implies a lower-dimensional representation of the original data.

### Applications of RBMs

1.  **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    -   RBMs are effective in reducing the dimensionality of data.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    -   Hidden layer values act as learned features, capturing essential patterns.
3.  **Collaborative Filtering:**
    -   RBMs excel in collaborative filtering, recommending items based on user preferences.

### Working Mechanism

-   RBMs reconstruct input data by activating hidden units.
-   Neurons in the hidden layer are responsible for learning and representing features.
-   RBMs are applied iteratively to various data points for learning.

### Use Cases

-   RBMs are employed in various applications, including:
    -   Dimensionality reduction
    -   Feature extraction
    -   Collaborative filtering

### Connection to Deep Belief Networks

-   RBMs serve as the main building blocks for Deep Belief Networks (DBNs).
-   DBNs are a type of deep neural network that leverages RBMs for hierarchical feature representation.

### Conclusion

-   RBMs offer a versatile solution for unsupervised learning tasks.
-   They find applications in diverse areas such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and collaborative filtering.
-   RBMs are foundational components in the construction of more complex deep neural network architectures.

## Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

    -   Training involves forward and backward passes to identify relevant features and relationships among input features.

### Training Process

1.  **Forward Pass:**
    -   Input image converted to binary values.
    -   Vector input fed into the network, multiplied by weights, and biased in each hidden unit.
    -   Result goes through an activation function (e.g., sigmoid) to determine hidden unit activation probability.
    -   Sample drawn from the probability distribution to decide which neurons activate.
2.  **Backward Pass:**
    -   Activated hidden neurons send results back to the visible layer for reconstruction.
    -   Information passed backward using the same weights and bias from the forward pass.
    -   Data in the visible layer shaped as the probability distribution of input values given hidden values.
    -   Sampling the distribution reconstructs the input.
3.  **Error Assessment and Adjustment:**
    -   Quality of reconstruction assessed by comparing it to the original data.
    -   RBM calculates error and adjusts weights and bias to minimize it.
    -   Error computed as the sum of squared differences between steps in each epoch.
    -   Steps repeated until the error is sufficiently low.

### Advantages of RBMs

1.  **Unlabeled Data Handling:**
    -   RBMs excel with unlabeled data, making them suitable for real-world datasets like videos, photos, and audio files.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    -   RBMs extract relevant features from input data, determining their importance and optimal combination for pattern formation.
3.  **Efficiency in Dimensionality Reduction:**
    -   RBMs are generally more efficient at dimensionality reduction compared to principal component analysis (PCA).
4.  **Self-Encoding Structure:**
    -   RBMs encode their own structure during the learning process.
    -   Classified under the autoencoder family, RBMs use a stochastic approach, distinguishing them from deterministic autoencoders.

### Conclusion

-   RBMs are powerful tools for unsupervised learning, handling unlabeled data efficiently.

-   Their feature extraction capabilities and self-encoding structure make them valuable in various applications.

## Autoencoders

### Introduction

-   Autoencoders are neural networks designed for unsupervised feature extraction from unlabeled inputs.
-   They aim to represent data in a low-dimensional feature set.
-   Autoencoders are widely used for tasks like face recognition without labeled data.

### Autoencoder Basics

-   An autoencoder's primary goal is to encode unlabeled inputs and then reconstruct them based on essential features.
-   Autoencoders are based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are a type of autoencoder.
-   Key differences: Autoencoders are shallow networks with multiple layers, while RBMs have only two layers.
-   Autoencoders use a deterministic approach compared to RBMs' stochastic approach.

### Architecture of Autoencoders

-   Autoencoders consist of an encoder and a decoder.
-   Encoder compresses the input representation (e.g., compressing a face from 2000 to 30 dimensions).
-   Decoder recreates the input and plays a crucial role in training.
-   During training, the decoder forces the autoencoder to select the most important features in the compressed representation.
-   The focus is on the code layer values, not the reconstructed image.

### Training Process

-   Autoencoders use backpropagation for learning.
-   The evaluation metric is the loss, representing the amount of information lost in input reconstruction.
-   The goal is to minimize the loss, making the output as close to the input as possible.

### Applications of Autoencoders

-   After training, encoded data with reduced dimensions can be used for various applications:
    -   Clustering
    -   Classification
    -   Visualization of data

### Conclusion

-   Autoencoders serve as unsupervised feature extraction techniques.
-   They are valuable for preparing data for other machine learning algorithms.
-   Understanding the structure and applications of autoencoders enhances their effective utilization.
